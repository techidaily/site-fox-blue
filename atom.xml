Various image attributes such as contrast, color, saturation, detail, black level, and white point can be enhanced whether it is movies, videos, or still images.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-color-grading"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-color-grading" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is color grading?"></a>Part 1. What is color grading?</h2><p>Color grading is the process of stylizing the color scheme of your footage by “painting” over what you’ve created using color correction. After the colorist completes the color correction, they can begin the process of grading the footage. During color grading, colorists use editing software to stylize the shot – emphasizing the visual tone and atmosphere of the film and making it look more cinematic.</p><p>Color sorting can be used for both technical and creative changes. Colorists use color gradation for artistic purposes to ensure that a film’s carefully selected color palette conveys a specific atmosphere, style, or emotion. For example, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/"><em>American Beauty (1999)</em></a> uses redder in dramatic moments to represent passion, anger, and power, whereas <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587310/"><em>Maleficent (2014)</em></a> uses green to represent danger, corruption, and darkness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-tutorial-1.jpg"                      alt="color grading tutorial"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial"></a>Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial</h2><h3 id="1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021"><a href="#1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021" class="headerlink" title="1.

According to most users, the built-in image viewer is not top of the list. As you keep reading, you will discover why Windows 10 Photos is not a good choice. In addition, you will find recommendations for fast image viewer Windows 10 and why they outrank the proprietary software.

Although the reasons vary between users, here are the main ones.</p><h4 id="1-It-is-slow"><a href="#1-It-is-slow" class="headerlink" title="1. It is slow"></a><strong>1. It is slow</strong></h4><p>The Photos app is not a fast photo viewer for Windows 10. Regardless of your computer’s specs, it takes approximately similar load times across all machines. Here are some of the reasons for this flaw:</p><ul><li>Photos take between 10 and 20 seconds to load because the program needs to check if you are connected to your One Drive account.</li><li>Accessing the app through your <strong>File Explorer menu</strong> will alsotake you a while, especially if you have other app extensions on the list.

The application crashes nearly every step of the photo viewing process. For example, it is common for your photo to freeze when saving your edits. As such, you have to restart the program and redo the adjustments.</p><h4 id="4-Horrible-user-experience"><a href="#4-Horrible-user-experience" class="headerlink" title="4.

Then, change your preferred app by selecting it from the <strong>Photos</strong> menu.</p><p>Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?</p><p>There are plenty of reasons why relying on Windows 10 photos for your creative work is a bad idea. Although the reasons vary between users, here are the main ones.</p><h4 id="1-It-is-slow-1"><a href="#1-It-is-slow-1" class="headerlink" title="1. It is slow"></a><strong>1. It is slow</strong></h4><p>The Photos app is not a fast photo viewer for Windows 10. Regardless of your computer’s specs, it takes approximately similar load times across all machines. Here are some of the reasons for this flaw:</p><ul><li>Photos take between 10 and 20 seconds to load because the program needs to check if you are connected to your One Drive account.</li><li>Accessing the app through your <strong>File Explorer menu</strong> will alsotake you a while, especially if you have other app extensions on the list. For example, if you have Windows 10 Photo viewer and MS Publisher active on the menu, Photo Viewer for Windows 10 takes a backseat.</li></ul><h4 id="2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process-1"><a href="#2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process-1" class="headerlink" title="2. It is bad at batch process"></a><strong>2. It is bad at batch process</strong></h4><p>For the amateur photographers reading this, photo batch processing is when you edit multiple pictures simultaneously. For example, image viewer Windows 10 lets you download multiple images with a single click.</p><p>However, that is about as much you can get when using the program compared to the dozens of photo enhancements you can do with other similar software.??</p><h4 id="3-Program-crash-galore-1"><a href="#3-Program-crash-galore-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Program crash galore"></a><strong>3. Program crash galore</strong></h4><p>It is fine for computer software to crash occasionally. However, Windows 10 Photo Viewer takes it to the next level. The application crashes nearly every step of the photo viewing process. For example, it is common for your photo to freeze when saving your edits. As such, you have to restart the program and redo the adjustments.</p><h4 id="4-Horrible-user-experience-1"><a href="#4-Horrible-user-experience-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

There is a difference between the two. Do you wish to see a recording for a longer time on screen? The slow-motion videos do exactly the same. A video’s motion is captured at a higher framerate than the actual speed of playback. i.e. the time observation is slowed down. For instance, if you add slow-motion effect to a 2 seconds video, it appears to last longer on the screen.</p><p> Whereas, a timelapse video is a sort of fast-forward. A time span that has lasted for long but while depicting it on screen, you speed up the perception of time or the actual time is the time-lapse.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123727/7443" target="_top" id="2123727">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123727" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123727/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Now, creating slow-motion videos on your Android is easy and fun with the above-mentioned apps.

Unlike the ordinary videos, virtual reality videos create in illusion of the user being part of the video through the rendition of 3D images. The viewing of such videos is not restricted to computer or television screens and depending on the video or the kind of content being watched, the user can also interact with the video.</p><p> Just like with the ordinary videos, virtual reality videos can be created at the beginning when a video is being recorded or captured using 360 degrees video cameras. The videos can also be made from computer generated content using VR immersive video enabled applications. The formats adopted by virtual reality videos will vary from the software and the device used in the production of the videos.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Differences-between-360°-video-and-VR-video"><a href="#Differences-between-360°-video-and-VR-video" class="headerlink" title="Differences between 360° video and VR video"></a>Differences between 360° video and VR video</h2><p> Virtual Reality is no longer the next big thing, but rather the current big thing. However, pockets of confusion still arise on the difference between them and<a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/virtual-reality/what-is-360-video.html" >360 degrees video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Some tend to confuse the two terms while others think they are one and the same thing.</p><p> Below are a few points to help shed more light on the differences between the two:</p><ul><li><strong>Environment</strong></li></ul><p> Virtual reality videos are primarily video generated content where users have the ability to immerse themselves in a virtual world and most of them are video game based. 360 degrees videos on the other hand, are video taken using physical 360 degrees cameras with the same depth as the human eye. This brings about a difference in perception between the 360 degrees video and virtual reality videos.</p><ul><li><strong>Mobility</strong></li></ul><p> Since the virtual reality experience is inspired by video games, users have the liberty to do whatever they want in the virtual environment. With 360 degrees videos however, a camera is placed at a physical location and whatever the user sees is what the filmmaker decided to view. The users don’t have the pleasure of exploring as they feel like as is usually the case with virtual reality videos.</p><ul><li><strong>Timeline</strong></li></ul><p> Unless it is an interactive film, 360 degrees videos will allow the filmmaker to control the story and the timeline of the video. In this sense, 360 degrees videos are immersive whereas the virtual reality videos are interactive with the timeline in VR videos solely on the hands of the viewer.</p><ul><li><strong>Story</strong></li></ul><p> In a virtual reality set up, the viewer or the player leads. This is not the case with 360 degrees videos where the filmmaker has to take control over the narrative and develop it forward. In virtual reality videos, the viewer or the player is experiencing a story happening to them while with the 360 degrees videos, the viewer is experiencing a story happening around them. Additionally, the physical location of the video is even more important in 360 degrees videos as compared to virtual reality videos where the location really is a big factor of consideration.</p><ul><li><strong>Platforms</strong></li></ul><p> For virtual reality experience, the user must have a virtual reality headset which can be tethered to a PC or a mobile device to access the content. 360 degrees video on the other hand doesn’t require any special devices such as VR headsets and are accessible through a variety of compatible players, either through mobile or desktop applications.</p><ul><li><strong>Photography</strong></li></ul><p> For virtual reality, the photography takes place in a digital environment while in 360 degrees videos the action is live in a physical environment with real characters.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105863/7443" target="_top" id="2105863">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105863" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105863/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-watch-Virtual-Realty-video"><a href="#How-to-watch-Virtual-Realty-video" class="headerlink" title="How to watch Virtual Realty video"></a>How to watch Virtual Realty video</h2><p> Related articles:<br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >iPhone Solution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/virtual-reality/watch-vr-360-video-on-android.html" >Android Solution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a><br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >PC Solution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> If you own an Android device, then you can easily watch virtual reality videos with the help of Google’s Cardboard. All you have to do is to slot the device into the cheaply made Cardboard viewer and start enjoying the VR experience, though on a lower grade.</p><p> For more enhanced virtual reality experience, you will be required to invest in a decent virtual reality headset which you can then use to get more immersive experiences when watching the content. Depending on the manufacturer of the headset, you may have to connect the headset to a PC - like in the case of the Oculus Rift by Facebook, or the headset may not need any extra addendums to work if you opt for Samsung Gear VR.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983545">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983545.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983545">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983545.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983545%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983545/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Where-to-watch-Virtual-Reality-video"><a href="#Where-to-watch-Virtual-Reality-video" class="headerlink" title="Where to watch Virtual Reality video"></a>Where to watch Virtual Reality video</h2><p> Related article:<br><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Where to Watch VR Content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> There are a variety of places where you can watch a plethora of virtual reality videos. The following are some of the best places to check out if you want to watch virtual reality videos-:</p><ul><li><strong>Virtual Reality via Apps</strong></li></ul><p> The number of apps being designed to for watching virtual reality videos keeps on increasing with each day. Currently, apps such as NYT VR and Vrse are designed to deliver VR-Ready videos which users can access using Google’s Cardboard. It implies that if you have an android device, then you can access these and many other similar virtual reality video apps.</p><ul><li><strong>Virtual Reality videos on YouTube</strong></li></ul><p> YouTube remains the ideal android destination whether you need 360 degrees or VR-primed videos. With the Cardboard, watching virtual reality videos on YouTube becomes so simple and so easy since all you have to do is to load the compatible video on your phone then simply tap on the Cardboard icon will be appearing on the lower right corner of your screen.</p><p> What will happen is that the screen will be split into two nearly identical frames, and when you insert the phone into the cardboard viewer, the images in the two identical frames will merge seamlessly to form one shot.</p><ul><li><strong>Virtual Reality videos locally</strong></li></ul><p> It will also please you to note that you can view virtual reality videos saved locally on your machine, but the experience will not be as good as tapping on the icon on YT. The main reason behind this is that the amount of downloadable virtual reality content is still scarce and firms prefer to make more money by streaming such videos and bookending them with ads instead of making them available as free downloads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132161/7443" target="_top" id="2132161">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132161" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132161/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-fusion-of-youtube-beats-and-imovie-editing-magic/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Fusion of YouTube Beats and iMovie Editing Magic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-green-canvas-essential-templates-to-enhance-your-cinematographic-journey/"><u>2024 Approved Green Canvas Essential Templates to Enhance Your Cinematographic Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-insiders-selection-prime-vr-device-picks/"><u>2024 Approved Insider's Selection Prime VR Device Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mixease-mac-and-windows-unifier/"><u>2024 Approved MIXEase Mac & Windows Unifier</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-optimal-4k-player-picks-best-8-free-cross-platform-compatible/"><u>2024 Approved Optimal 4K Player Picks Best 8 FREE, Cross-Platform Compatible</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-optimizing-your-podcasts-the-seo-blueprint/"><u>2024 Approved Optimizing Your Podcasts The SEO Blueprint</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-premium-6-choices-for-cost-effective-4k-projection/"><u>2024 Approved Premium 6 Choices for Cost-Effective 4K Projection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-snapcutmaster-insights-full-scrutiny/"><u>2024 Approved SnapCutMaster Insights – Full Scrutiny</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-pgsharp-save-you-from-ban-while-spoofing-pokemon-go-on-oneplus-nord-n30-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How PGSharp Save You from Ban While Spoofing Pokemon Go On OnePlus Nord N30 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-5-car-locator-apps-for-vivo-y100-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 5 Car Locator Apps for Vivo Y100 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/in-2024-unveiling-dji-phantom-3-a-complete-technical-review/"><u>In 2024, Unveiling DJI Phantom 3 A Complete Technical Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/1719575464700-learn-languages-unlock-potential-start-with-slovak-in-a-days-work/"><u>Learn Languages, Unlock Potential: Start with Slovak in a Day's Work</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/secure-and-fast-the-latest-nvidia-mx150-drivers-for-your-windows-laptop-or-desktop/"><u>Secure & Fast: The Latest NVIDIA MX150 Drivers for Your Windows Laptop or Desktop</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

As we all know, many podcasters are doing all it takes to get their podcast to the right audience, but the truth is you don’t just publish a podcast any day. Although this might sound weird to newbies, professionals should know this.</p><p>You need to have a specific day(s) with time to release your podcast and stick to it. Doing so will allow you to build trust and loyalty amongst listeners.</p><p>With that said, knowing the best day to release a podcast is crucial for any podcaster, and in this article, we’ll enlighten you on all you need to know about that. So, just stick with us to find out more.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Does-Podcast-Publishing-Schedule-Matter"><a href="#Part-1-Does-Podcast-Publishing-Schedule-Matter" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Does Podcast Publishing Schedule Matter?"></a>Part 1: Does Podcast Publishing Schedule Matter?</h2><p>Having a podcast publishing schedule might sound negligible, but it is very essential for every podcaster, especially newbies. Listeners will stick to your podcast if they find it interesting, but to make them loyal, you need to build trust by publishing podcasts regularly on specific days and times every week. In addition, doing this will make your podcast more relevant in the space.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that choosing a suitable publishing schedule for your podcast depends on the niche you focus on and your target audience. So, when making such a decision, it’s crucial to opt for the days you can stay consistent with.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Best-Day-To-Release-a-Podcast-The-Megaphone-Report"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Best-Day-To-Release-a-Podcast-The-Megaphone-Report" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Is the Best Day To Release a Podcast? (The Megaphone Report)"></a>Part 2: What Is the Best Day To Release a Podcast? (The Megaphone Report)</h2><p>Truth be told, no specific day is considered the best to release a podcast. However, Megaphone’s report on the daily podcast publishes report shows that podcasters tend to publish their podcast more on weekdays (Monday - Friday) between 2 AM, 5 AM, and 11 PM. The chart below explains the stat report better.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-day-to-release-a-podcast-1.jpg"                      alt="best-day-to-release-a-podcast"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902294/19272" target="_top" id="1902294">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902294" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902294/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>As you can see from the chart above, the best day to publish a podcast is on weekdays. But check the following chart to see the median number of total downloads for every podcast episode posted per hour during the weekdays.</p><p>The chart on the left is the number of episodes published per hour from Monday to Friday, while the chart on the left displays the median total downloads of episodes the podcast episodes get over time.</p><p>Overall, it shows that podcast episodes published in the early hours of a new day tend to do better until 5 AM when their performance starts to drop. However, episodes published just before noon does best in the afternoon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/best-day-to-release-a-podcast-2.jpg"                      alt="best-day-to-release-a-podcast"                ></p><h3 id="Takeaways-for-the-best-day-to-release-a-podcast"><a href="#Takeaways-for-the-best-day-to-release-a-podcast" class="headerlink" title="Takeaways for the best day to release a podcast"></a>Takeaways for the best day to release a podcast</h3><p>Here is our take on the podcast publish statistics analyzed by Megaphone in the charts above.</p><p><strong>1. Weekdays are much more popular than weekends</strong></p><p>From the podcast publish days’ statistics in the chart above, it’s obvious most podcasters publish on weekdays compared to weekends. Yes, over 40,000 podcast episodes are published during weekdays while on weekends, it’s within 4,000 to 5,000 episodes. The publishing time usually falls between 2 AM to 5 AM.</p><p>However, in our opinion, we don’t recommend publishing a new podcast at midnight, instead do it by 5 AM. This is will prevent the risk of your podcast getting buried under other podcasters’ shows on the app you are using, and enhance the chances of your podcast being on the first page, thus making it easily seen by your audience.</p><p><strong>2. When is the most popular publishing day?</strong></p><p>Based on the chart above, Wednesday is when the most podcast episodes are published. Over 9000 podcast episodes are published on this day, and the hour with the highest number of publishing is 2 AM.</p><p>But does this mean you should publish your podcast at exactly 2 AM on Wednesday? No! Instead, consider when your audience is most likely to listen. Will they prefer to tune in on their way to work, during work, on their way home, while doing house chores at home, or at night? You need to have a breakdown of this data, so you can choose the best time to publish your podcast.</p><p><strong>3. When is the worst?</strong></p><p>The worst day to publish a podcast is on Sunday, and as mentioned earlier, if you’re publishing during weekdays, do not publish at midnight. But note that the niche of your podcast matters. If Saturday and Sunday are when your audience tends to listen to your podcasts, then don’t hesitate to publish new episodes on weekends.</p><p>The hour with the most downloads per average episode is 5 AM Tuesday, followed by 5 AM Friday and 5 AM Thursday. Still, as mentioned earlier the time when your audience is most like to listen to the podcast matters.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151890/7443" target="_top" id="2151890">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151890" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151890/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Warning-Downfall-Don’t-Post-at-the-Time-Others-Do"><a href="#Part-3-Warning-Downfall-Don’t-Post-at-the-Time-Others-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Warning Downfall: Don’t Post at the Time Others Do"></a>Part 3: Warning Downfall: Don’t Post at the Time Others Do</h2><p>The charts above were published by Megaphone based on the podcast episodes published on their platform. However, if you intend to choose the days to publish a podcast based on that, then it’s sad to say you’re about to make a big mistake.</p><p>The truth is it takes time and consistency to find the best days to publish podcasts. Even successful podcasters you see today never had the best days have the best days to publish content when they started. So, before you rush to start posting your podcast based on the chart or how other podcasters upload content, here are things you should know;</p><h3 id="1-Different-podcast-platforms-have-different-algorithms"><a href="#1-Different-podcast-platforms-have-different-algorithms" class="headerlink" title="1. Different podcast platforms have different algorithms"></a>1. Different podcast platforms have different algorithms</h3><p>If you conduct an analysis of how podcast platforms work, you’ll discover all podcast platforms don’t have the same algorithm. For example, the way the Apple Podcast app works can be the same as that of Spotify, Player FM, Stitcher, and many others.</p><p>During our review of different podcast apps, we discovered Apple Podcast app algorithm tends to favor newer episodes, except if you have a show you haven’t listened to in a while. There are also podcast apps with a similar algorithm, but the best time and day to publish podcasts varies.</p><h3 id="2-What-works-for-other-podcasters-might-not-work-for-You"><a href="#2-What-works-for-other-podcasters-might-not-work-for-You" class="headerlink" title="2. What works for other podcasters might not work for You"></a>2. What works for other podcasters might not work for You</h3><p>Just as the saying goes, “One man’s food could be another man’s poison”. Many regular podcasters usually upload content today because other podcasters have done the same. But unfortunately, it’s not a good move to just do things because others are doing it in the podcasting space. So, it’s advisable not to post at the same time others do.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130870/7443" target="_top" id="2130870">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130870" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130870/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tips-Takeaways-to-find-the-best-day-for-your-podcast-show"><a href="#Tips-Takeaways-to-find-the-best-day-for-your-podcast-show" class="headerlink" title="Tips &amp; Takeaways to find the best day for your podcast show"></a>Tips &amp; Takeaways to find the best day for your podcast show</h3><p>We absolutely can’t help you choose the best day to release a podcast. However, the following tips could help you decide what day and time will suit your podcast show.</p><p><strong>a. Avoid times when your audience will hardly listen to your podcast</strong></p><p>Most people look for podcasts when they are looking for information conversationally. So, you must do findings on knowing when your audience will want to listen to your podcast, though research shows that more people listen to podcasts on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday between 2 AM and 5 AM. But 5 AM is the best time to gather more downloads.</p><p><strong>b. Try to tie it to something more predictable</strong></p><p>Sometimes, you just need to think out of the box when choosing the best day for your podcast. For example, we know weekdays are for going to work, and more people tend to download podcasts by 5 AM on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. So, if your podcast is about “Things you should do at work to make your day less stressful”, there’s a high chance of getting more downloads, as it’ll attract many workers facing a similar problem daily.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Regularly-Produce-Podcasts-for-Posting"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Regularly-Produce-Podcasts-for-Posting" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How To Regularly Produce Podcasts for Posting?"></a>Part 4: How To Regularly Produce Podcasts for Posting?</h2><p>After making up your mind on the best day to release a podcast, your next move should be to start producing podcasts for posting. But the question is, “How do you record and edit a podcast?’ Well, this is where Filmora comes into the game.</p><p>Filmora is a professional video editing software that boasts excellent video and audio editing functionalities.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Mastering-Shadows-Highlights-Through-Photoshop-Curves"><a href="#Mastering-Shadows-Highlights-Through-Photoshop-Curves" class="headerlink" title="Mastering Shadows &amp; Highlights Through Photoshop Curves"></a>Mastering Shadows &amp; Highlights Through Photoshop Curves</h2><p>In this Photoshop tutorial, we’re going to carve an image using four simple steps. Curving an image can be a great way to add some extra visual interest and dimension, and it’s a technique that can be used with a wide range of images. So, let’s get started!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/curve-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="curve image photoshop"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Simple-Steps-to-Curve-an-Image-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Simple-Steps-to-Curve-an-Image-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Simple Steps to Curve an Image in Photoshop"></a>Simple Steps to Curve an Image in Photoshop</h2><h5 id="Step1Create-a-New-Document"><a href="#Step1Create-a-New-Document" class="headerlink" title="Step1Create a New Document"></a>Step1Create a New Document</h5><p>To keep things simple, let’s start with a white canvas. Let’s open a new document now by going to File in the menu bar and tapping New. Alternatively, you may press Ctrl+N or Command+N on your keyboard to generate a new document. Choose a size and orientation that is appropriate for your image.</p><h5 id="Step2Place-the-Image"><a href="#Step2Place-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step2Place the Image"></a>Step2Place the Image</h5><p>After creating the new document, open the image that you want to curve. You may do so by going to File &gt; Open in the menu bar or pressing Ctrl+O or Command+O on your keyboard. Once the image is open, go to Edit in the menu bar and select Place Embedded from the drop-down menu that appears. Select your image and click Place. The image will be placed on the canvas. If the document’s size does not match that of the image, you will see a transformation box surrounding the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/place-image-in-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="place image in photoshop"                ></p><h5 id="Step3Warp-the-Image"><a href="#Step3Warp-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step3Warp the Image"></a>Step3Warp the Image</h5><p>Now we’ll curve the image using the Warp Tool. Select the Warp Tool by clicking and holding on the Transform Tool in the toolbar. The Warp Tool is located at the bottom of the Transform Tool’s fly-out menu. Alternatively, you may press Ctrl+T or Command+T on your keyboard to open the Transform Tool’s fly-out menu and then select the Warp Tool from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/wrap-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="wrap image photoshop"                ></p><p>With the Warp Tool selected, hover your cursor over the image. You’ll see a grid appear over the image. Click and drag one of the middle nodes in the horizontal direction to begin curving the image. As you drag, you’ll see the image curve along with your cursor. If you want to increase or decrease the amount of curvature, simply press and hold the Shift key while dragging the node.</p><p>Play around with the settings in the options bar. There are quite a few different looks you can achieve just by adjusting these.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/change-image-height-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="change image height photoshop"                ></p><p>20% <strong>Horizontal Distortion</strong> makes one side of the image appear larger than the other. This is what my photo looks like at 20%.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/change-horizontal-distortion-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="change horizontal distortion photoshop"                ></p><p><strong>Vertical Distortion</strong> makes the image look as if it’s leaning backward.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/verticle-distortion-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="verticle distortion image photoshop"                ></p><p>The <strong>Bend Direction</strong> option rotates the angle of the bend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/bend-direction-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="bend direction image photoshop"                ></p><p>Flip any of these effects in the opposite direction by placing a negative sign in front of the percentage. Here’s -20% in the <strong>Bend</strong> box with a vertical bend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/flip-effect-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="flip effect image photoshop"                ></p><h5 id="Step4Save-the-Image"><a href="#Step4Save-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step4Save the Image"></a>Step4Save the Image</h5><p>Once you’re happy with the way your image looks, go to File &gt; Save As in the menu bar or press Ctrl+Shift+S or Command+Shift+S on your keyboard. Choose a file format and location to save your image and click Save. And that’s it!

You can control photos as well as videos from a single button on the top - press it one time to capture stills and twice to record videos. One more button is available for Wi-Fi control that also assists in making connection with Cube+ application. You will find a Micro-USB slot and MicroSD card slot behind the door.</p><p> In case of GoPro Hero4 Session, you will not find any LCD screen on this device but you can view scenes on smart phone screen with app connectivity. On the top portion you will find a monochrome LCD panel that assists in easy setting for memory, battery, shooting modes as well as menu. Memory Card slot and USB connector is available besides the door. One LED on front and another on back keeps on indicating recording and wireless activities.</p><h4 id="2-Battery-and-Charging"><a href="#2-Battery-and-Charging" class="headerlink" title="2.Battery and Charging"></a>2.Battery and Charging</h4><p> The Lithium Ion battery of GoPro Hero Session can serve you up to 2 hours with 1080p recording at 30fps frame rate. If you keep your Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on and capture 8MP photos once&#x2F;second then this battery will work up to 3 hour 35 minutes. For Cube+, the battery will serve you up to 1.5 hours even if you have Wi-Fi in ON position. You can charge its battery via Micro USB port using a simple USB power pack, computer or AC-USB Adapter.</p><h4 id="3-Waterproof"><a href="#3-Waterproof" class="headerlink" title="3.Waterproof"></a>3.Waterproof</h4><p> You can take GoPro Hero Session device under water up to 10 meter or 33 feet even without any additional protective housing. The waterproof case of this device possesses small openings from front as well as back side and GoPro producers say that it improves audio quality of device.</p><p> The Polaroid Cube+ camera is splashproof, so it is not advised to carry this camera for scuba diving. It can handle just a casual exposure to rain or just splashes. To get a high quality waterproof housing for your device you need to pay additional amount as case is not included in the package.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn more about the Best Waterproof Action Cameras in 2017 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="4-Accessories"><a href="#4-Accessories" class="headerlink" title="4.Accessories"></a>4.Accessories</h4><p> The Session camera box contains a Micro USB cable, flat and curved adhesive mounts, locking screws and three mounting buckles.</p><p> The Polaroid Cube+ package includes an instruction manual, Micro SD card (8GB) and Micro USB Cable.

You can follow 60fps and 30fps frame rate with 1080p and 720p resolution whereas slow motion mode can be switched with 720p and 120fps. For taking stills you can easily switch between 3MP, 6Mp and 8MP where automatic exposure effect leads to much impressive results in daylight. But in case of low light performance you may feel little disappointed. The image stabilization feature is a better addition for video modes.</p><p> There is no doubt to say that photo and video mode of Hero Session are impressive with outstanding audio quality. You can switch between various videos modes as: 1440p with 25&#x2F;30 fps, 1080p with 25&#x2F;30&#x2F;48&#x2F;50&#x2F;60fps, 960 with 25&#x2F;30&#x2F;50&#x2F;60 fps and 720p at 25&#x2F;30&#x2F;50&#x2F;60 and 100fps. You can also grab amazing results for slow motion recording with 120fps and 100 fps frame rate but preferably switch to 720 at 100fps to get good results. Users are also able to enjoy ProTune feature along with auto low light mode.

According to most users, the built-in image viewer is not top of the list. As you keep reading, you will discover why Windows 10 Photos is not a good choice. In addition, you will find recommendations for fast image viewer Windows 10 and why they outrank the proprietary software. Finally, remember that the list contains free and paid programs you can use for your creative work.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">PhotoDirector 365</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">XnView Classic</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">IrfanView Graphic Viewer</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">WidsMob Viewer Pro</a></li><li><a href="#part2-5">Image Glass</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Best Free Video Editor to Make Slideshow with Photos</a></li><li><a href="#part4">FAQs</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part1-Why-Windows-10-photos-is-not-a-good-choice"><a href="#Part1-Why-Windows-10-photos-is-not-a-good-choice" class="headerlink" title="Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?"></a>Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?</h2><p>There are plenty of reasons why relying on Windows 10 photos for your creative work is a bad idea. Although the reasons vary between users, here are the main ones.</p><h4 id="1-It-is-slow"><a href="#1-It-is-slow" class="headerlink" title="1. It is slow"></a><strong>1. It is slow</strong></h4><p>The Photos app is not a fast photo viewer for Windows 10. Regardless of your computer’s specs, it takes approximately similar load times across all machines. Here are some of the reasons for this flaw:</p><ul><li>Photos take between 10 and 20 seconds to load because the program needs to check if you are connected to your One Drive account.</li><li>Accessing the app through your <strong>File Explorer menu</strong> will alsotake you a while, especially if you have other app extensions on the list. For example, if you have Windows 10 Photo viewer and MS Publisher active on the menu, Photo Viewer for Windows 10 takes a backseat.</li></ul><h4 id="2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process"><a href="#2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process" class="headerlink" title="2. It is bad at batch process"></a><strong>2. It is bad at batch process</strong></h4><p>For the amateur photographers reading this, photo batch processing is when you edit multiple pictures simultaneously. For example, image viewer Windows 10 lets you download multiple images with a single click.</p><p>However, that is about as much you can get when using the program compared to the dozens of photo enhancements you can do with other similar software.??</p><h4 id="3-Program-crash-galore"><a href="#3-Program-crash-galore" class="headerlink" title="3. Program crash galore"></a><strong>3. Program crash galore</strong></h4><p>It is fine for computer software to crash occasionally. However, Windows 10 Photo Viewer takes it to the next level. The application crashes nearly every step of the photo viewing process. For example, it is common for your photo to freeze when saving your edits. As such, you have to restart the program and redo the adjustments.</p><h4 id="4-Horrible-user-experience"><a href="#4-Horrible-user-experience" class="headerlink" title="4. Horrible user experience"></a><strong>4. Horrible user experience</strong></h4><p>How quickly can you save a file to the cloud? Most programs take seconds. Unfortunately, using image viewer Windows 10 is a completely different ball game.?</p><p>First, you have to save a copy of your photo. Then, find the duplicate and then upload it to One Drive. What a nightmare!</p><h2 id="Part2-Top-Best-Fast-Photo-Viewer-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Part2-Top-Best-Fast-Photo-Viewer-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Top Best Fast Photo Viewer for Windows 10"></a>Part2: Top Best Fast Photo Viewer for Windows 10</h2><p>There are several more reasons why you should not use photo viewer for Windows 10.

You need a license to enable all the post-production features of the software. In addition, most free image viewers offer basic editing tools to create a professional job.</p><h4 id="2-How-can-you-switch-from-photo-viewer-for-Windows-10-to-your-preferred-software"><a href="#2-How-can-you-switch-from-photo-viewer-for-Windows-10-to-your-preferred-software" class="headerlink" title="2. How can you switch from photo viewer for Windows 10 to your preferred software?"></a>2. How can you switch from photo viewer for Windows 10 to your preferred software?</h4><p>Access the <strong>Default Apps</strong> menu from the <strong>Settings</strong> option of your OS. Then, change your preferred app by selecting it from the <strong>Photos</strong> menu.</p><p>Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?</p><p>There are plenty of reasons why relying on Windows 10 photos for your creative work is a bad idea. Although the reasons vary between users, here are the main ones.</p><h4 id="1-It-is-slow-1"><a href="#1-It-is-slow-1" class="headerlink" title="1. It is slow"></a><strong>1. It is slow</strong></h4><p>The Photos app is not a fast photo viewer for Windows 10. Regardless of your computer’s specs, it takes approximately similar load times across all machines. Here are some of the reasons for this flaw:</p><ul><li>Photos take between 10 and 20 seconds to load because the program needs to check if you are connected to your One Drive account.</li><li>Accessing the app through your <strong>File Explorer menu</strong> will alsotake you a while, especially if you have other app extensions on the list. For example, if you have Windows 10 Photo viewer and MS Publisher active on the menu, Photo Viewer for Windows 10 takes a backseat.</li></ul><h4 id="2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process-1"><a href="#2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process-1" class="headerlink" title="2. It is bad at batch process"></a><strong>2. It is bad at batch process</strong></h4><p>For the amateur photographers reading this, photo batch processing is when you edit multiple pictures simultaneously. For example, image viewer Windows 10 lets you download multiple images with a single click.</p><p>However, that is about as much you can get when using the program compared to the dozens of photo enhancements you can do with other similar software.??</p><h4 id="3-Program-crash-galore-1"><a href="#3-Program-crash-galore-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Program crash galore"></a><strong>3. Program crash galore</strong></h4><p>It is fine for computer software to crash occasionally. However, Windows 10 Photo Viewer takes it to the next level. The application crashes nearly every step of the photo viewing process. For example, it is common for your photo to freeze when saving your edits. As such, you have to restart the program and redo the adjustments.</p><h4 id="4-Horrible-user-experience-1"><a href="#4-Horrible-user-experience-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Horrible user experience"></a><strong>4. Horrible user experience</strong></h4><p>How quickly can you save a file to the cloud? Most programs take seconds. Unfortunately, using image viewer Windows 10 is a completely different ball game.?</p><p>First, you have to save a copy of your photo. Then, find the duplicate and then upload it to One Drive.

For AVI to GIF conversion, knowing what they are should help.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Parameter of Comparison</strong></th><th><strong>GIF</strong></th><th><strong>AVI</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Created by</strong></td><td>CompuServ</td><td>Microsoft</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of Development</strong></td><td>June 15, 1987</td><td>November 10, 1992</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Latest Update Date</strong></td><td>1989</td><td>1996</td></tr><tr><td><strong>File Extension</strong></td><td>.GIF</td><td>.AVI</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sharing Speed</strong></td><td>It is easy and fast to share GIF files between devices due to their smaller size.</td><td>Since the file is larger in size, the overall speed of transfer would be high.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Type of Format</strong></td><td>Bitmap lossless image format</td><td>Container format</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Container For</strong></td><td>-</td><td>Video, audio</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pros</strong></td><td>Compressed file (small size)</td><td>High-quality resolution of the video (upto 4K&#x2F;8K)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cons</strong></td><td>It does not allow much editing.</td><td>The file size can get to very big size limits.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Support for B-Frames</strong></td><td>B-framing is compatible with GIFs.</td><td>It was not made with b-frames in consideration but can work with it.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Maximum Duration Supported</strong></td><td>The GIF files can extend to 15 seconds maximum.</td><td>The length and duration of these files a user can prepare&#x2F;keep depend on their limit of file storage capacity.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Variable Bit Rate Audio</strong></td><td>Not supported.</td><td>It can be detected in AVI and is generally non-standard.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Variable Frame Rate</strong></td><td>GIFs calculate delay render duration per frame, and they run in milliseconds.
