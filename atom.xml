It may differ due to embedded audio, different frame sizes, and Aspect Ratios. Let us take an example of a video:</p><p>The Framerate &#x3D; 30</p><p>The Bitrate &#x3D; 25</p><p>The Format &#x3D; HDV 720</p><p>In this case, the total space occupied by this 24- hour video file is 263.67 GB.</p><p>The most important factor in measuring the file size is the bit rate. <strong>The Bitrate is the measure of the amount of information transmitted every second</strong>. It is measured in Mbps or Kbps. Following is the table, you can use to adjust the file size with different bit rates and frame rates.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-file-size-1.jpg"                      alt="video-file-size"                ></p><p><strong>What is a Video Compression?</strong></p><p><strong>“The process of reducing the video size to</strong></p><p> <strong>upload and download fast is known as the File Compression”</strong></p><p>A good video compressor can easily reduce the size of a video up to 1000 times smaller than the original video.

However, it was really difficult for me to put such a large video file, upload it into a hard drive and then ship it. Since the video is too long and I need to compress the video footage. Therefore, I compressed my file using file compression tool and timely sent my task to the client.

Alternatively, if you are using google drive or drop box, they limit to management space you have unless you have to pay for it.</p><p>I would share some examples of I have been working with a client. One of the things he asked me is to make a large video, edit it and send me within a day. However, it was really difficult for me to put such a large video file, upload it into a hard drive and then ship it. Since the video is too long and I need to compress the video footage. Therefore, I compressed my file using file compression tool and timely sent my task to the client.

If you shoot a video on your cell phone, you need to compress it before sending it to cloud storage as the original file will take up a big space on the cloud storage. In the same way, if you need to send a file via email, you need to reduce the size of your file as you can only send a maximum of 25 MB file.</p><p>You can simply compress your large video file into a compressed or small video file without losing the quality of the final video whether you are using Windows, Mac, iPhone, or whatever the device is. In the same way, you can compress your YouTube videos to easily edit short videos, take less space for uploading, and are buffered fast at the viewer’s end.</p><h2 id="How-do-Compress-a-Long-Video-to-a-Small-Size-2"><a href="#How-do-Compress-a-Long-Video-to-a-Small-Size-2" class="headerlink" title="How do Compress a Long Video to a Small Size?"></a><strong>How do Compress a Long Video to a Small Size?</strong></h2><p>A properly compressed file can easily be uploaded and downloaded and in some cases, playback will be smoother.

For example; a <strong>100MB</strong> video can be compressed into an <strong>8MB</strong> video with no visible difference.</p><p>There are two simple methods to reduce the size of your video:</p><p>Firstly, you can trim the unnecessary beginning and end parts of your video. It will help you reduce the video size.</p><p>Secondly, you can remove the unnecessary audio, if your video looks good without background music, you can delete it to get the extra space. Sometimes, the actions in the video are so powerful that there is no need for audio. In this case, you can remove audio and get space without losing the quality of the video.</p><p>On the other hand, a video compressor can harm your data and corrupt your file so, you should use proper software by following these steps to avoid data loss.

It seems difficult but it’s pretty simple, you have not to do it with your hands like cutting down the stuff instead there are a number of tools and applications that reduces the size of a file within n few seconds in the palm of your hand.</p><p>The question is, why would you need to reduce the size of a file?</p><p>When you export large video files, it would take hours to upload. Alternatively, if you are using google drive or drop box, they limit to management space you have unless you have to pay for it.</p><p>I would share some examples of I have been working with a client. One of the things he asked me is to make a large video, edit it and send me within a day. However, it was really difficult for me to put such a large video file, upload it into a hard drive and then ship it. Since the video is too long and I need to compress the video footage. Therefore, I compressed my file using file compression tool and timely sent my task to the client. In this article, you would learn how to how to compress a large video file into a smaller one without compromising the quality of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-file-size-2.jpg"                      alt="video-file-size"                ></p><h2 id="Can-I-Reduce-the-File-Size-for-a-Long-Video-3"><a href="#Can-I-Reduce-the-File-Size-for-a-Long-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Can I Reduce the File Size for a Long Video?"></a><strong>Can I Reduce the File Size for a Long Video?</strong></h2><p>Yes, you can compress your large video file into a smaller video within a few clicks in seconds. If you shoot a video on your cell phone, you need to compress it before sending it to cloud storage as the original file will take up a big space on the cloud storage. In the same way, if you need to send a file via email, you need to reduce the size of your file as you can only send a maximum of 25 MB file.</p><p>You can simply compress your large video file into a compressed or small video file without losing the quality of the final video whether you are using Windows, Mac, iPhone, or whatever the device is. In the same way, you can compress your YouTube videos to easily edit short videos, take less space for uploading, and are buffered fast at the viewer’s end.</p><h2 id="How-do-Compress-a-Long-Video-to-a-Small-Size-3"><a href="#How-do-Compress-a-Long-Video-to-a-Small-Size-3" class="headerlink" title="How do Compress a Long Video to a Small Size?"></a><strong>How do Compress a Long Video to a Small Size?</strong></h2><p>A properly compressed file can easily be uploaded and downloaded and in some cases, playback will be smoother. This can easily be done without losing the quality of the video. Compressing a video reduces the file size of the video. So, takes less space on your hard drive. For example; a <strong>100MB</strong> video can be compressed into an <strong>8MB</strong> video with no visible difference.</p><p>There are two simple methods to reduce the size of your video:</p><p>Firstly, you can trim the unnecessary beginning and end parts of your video. It will help you reduce the video size.</p><p>Secondly, you can remove the unnecessary audio, if your video looks good without background music, you can delete it to get the extra space. Sometimes, the actions in the video are so powerful that there is no need for audio. In this case, you can remove audio and get space without losing the quality of the video.</p><p>On the other hand, a video compressor can harm your data and corrupt your file so, you should use proper software by following these steps to avoid data loss.

It might it be the newest or most refined product on the market, but it is fairly reliable for a tablet controlled hobby drone.</p><h4 id="1-Features"><a href="#1-Features" class="headerlink" title="1.  Features"></a>1.  Features</h4><p> Some of the main features of this drone include the refined application which is available for iOS and Android smart phones and tablets. This is an application that Parrot uses with many of their drones and they have created separate versions for every major drone they produce. The version of the application for the quad copter is easy to get started with and free to download. As well as offering piloting control is you can record and share videos as well as pictures directly from the application to social media or to other devices within your home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/parrot-ar-free-flight-app.png"                      alt="parrot ar freeflight app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Q8Feep0Rc0?si=YkPhRxXGvrRRMJtb" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The drone features a camera for high-definition live video streaming, recording and still photos. The drone also features a live view that can be used with the app for flying the drone. This can help with maneuverability and with learning how to fly the drone.</p><h4 id="2-Design"><a href="#2-Design" class="headerlink" title="2.  Design"></a>2.  Design</h4><p> The main design for this drone is mirroring the look of camouflage. The main component used in the construction of the drone is plastic and Styrofoam. This case an extremely lightweight but the drone also doesn’t come with many of the safeguards in ultrasound sensors that many of the other drones in the professional Parrot line have to offer. As a result, more of the focus is placed on the pilot in actually flying the drone. The good news is that there are a wealth of settings available in the application to help with takeoff and landing. It can take more time to master but with the lightweight construction of the drone, it is very maneuverable.</p><p> The lightweight construction however can run into problems during a crash. This is not a drone that is designed to survive a hard landing or collisions. It also doesn’t fly particularly well in poor weather.</p><h4 id="3-Battery-Life"><a href="#3-Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="3.  Battery Life"></a>3.  Battery Life</h4><p> The battery life on this drone is considerably shorter than many of the other drones available in its size. The main problem that you can face when piloting this drone is its 5 to 10 min. flight time. If you have settings on the drone to safely land when it reaches near the end of its battery life, you can expect of flight time of just 6 min. on average. This flight time is remedied by purchasing the extended battery from Parrot for an additional $50. This can often extend flight time to at least 10 to 15 min. with a maximum flight time of 18 min..</p><h4 id="4-Performance-in-Flight"><a href="#4-Performance-in-Flight" class="headerlink" title="4.  Performance in Flight"></a>4.  Performance in Flight</h4><p> The takeoff and landing settings can really ease the process of learning how to fly this drone. The app is extremely responsive and the lightweight nature of the drawn makes it very maneuverable while it is in flight. This drone has become a favorite toy in the community to learn how to perform flips and other air trips. With a recommended flight height of within 50 ft this drone can climb fast and perform quite well in fairly calm conditions.</p><h4 id="5-Control-Range"><a href="#5-Control-Range" class="headerlink" title="5.  Control Range"></a>5.  Control Range</h4><p> The control Range on this drone is relatively low as it is operated via Wi-Fi hotspot. In most cases the drone can be controlled within 35 yards but the signal can get week outside of this zone. Making sure to keep the drone relatively close will make sure that safety protocols are not turned on for an automatic landing or so that the drone does not crash.</p><h4 id="6-Camera-quality"><a href="#6-Camera-quality" class="headerlink" title="6.  Camera quality"></a>6.  Camera quality</h4><p> The camera quality on this drone is capable of producing a 720P picture. It doesn’t come with an additional mount so your camera quality is quite restricted. The image quality from the drone is fair but definitely not something that you would want to use for ongoing filming or still capture in the air.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XIUatTFH0Zw?si=ZCtoBtIy18y2F5Vc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/choes-of-the-past-the-top-10-youtube-sources-for-history-lovers/"><u>[New] Echoes of the Past The Top 10 YouTube Sources for History Lovers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-quality-overload-top-10-hd-video-apps-for-your-android/"><u>[New] Quality Overload Top 10 HD Video Apps for Your Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-why-my-instagram-videos-turned-upside-down-whats-going-on-in-2024/"><u>[New] Why My Instagram Videos Turned Upside Down – What's Going On, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unveiling-the-secrets-acquiring-attractive-pexel-photos/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Unveiling the Secrets Acquiring Attractive Pexel Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-undead-unleashed-discovering-the-ultimate-zombie-games-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Undead Unleashed Discovering the Ultimate Zombie Games for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/achieve-stellar-clickthrough-rates-via-thumbnail-enlargement-on-youtube/"><u>Achieve Stellar Clickthrough Rates via Thumbnail Enlargement on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/building-a-greener-future-with-technology-top-5-tips-for-achieving-tech-based-eco-friendliness-advice-from-zdnet-experts/"><u>Building a Greener Future with Technology: Top 5 Tips for Achieving Tech-Based Eco-Friendliness | Advice From ZDNet Experts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/efficient-workflow-tips-using-the-screensplit-feature-on-macbook-air-for-enhanced-productivity/"><u>Efficient Workflow Tips: Using the Screensplit Feature on MacBook Air for Enhanced Productivity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-deleted-nokia-pictures-an-easy-method-explained-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/"><u>How to Restore Deleted Nokia Pictures An Easy Method Explained.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/in-2024-core-concepts-in-digital-animation/"><u>In 2024, Core Concepts in Digital Animation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/insta360-one-x2-a-buyers-guide-for-water-enthusiasts/"><u>Insta360 One X2: A Buyer's Guide for Water Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/photo-perfection-instructions-for-text-overlay-on-windowsmacos/"><u>Photo Perfection Instructions for Text Overlay on Windows/MacOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/tips-to-undo-an-unintended-repost-in-your-tiktok-feed/"><u>Tips to Undo an Unintended Repost in Your TikTok Feed</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Please explain to me”.</p><p>One of the fascinating aspects of technology is the never-ending innovation. However, TV terminologies can be quite confusing, that even new technologies in the industry become hard to understand.</p><p>Quantum HDR is one of the latest technologies in the TV industry that many folks still find too hard to understand.</p><p>Perhaps you’ve heard about Quantum HDR once or twice, but you still didn’t know what the technology is all about, worry less because you’ve come to the right page to find out the unknown.</p><p>Here, we’ve covered all you need to know about Quantum HDR. So it’s advisable that you read this article till the end.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LaGNHfAT92w?si=bvHo1iYK2JBIPtRo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Quantum-HDR"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Quantum-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Quantum HDR"></a>Part 1: What is Quantum HDR</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/quantum-hdr-everything-you-may-want-to-know-about-quantum-hdr-1.jpg"                      alt="quantum hdr"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/td3ojuzhloY?si=N_maQNiJWrJp7XZl" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Just as the name suggests, Quantum HDR is a combination of two amazing technologies namely, ‘Quantum Dots and HDR (High dynamic range).</p><p>“Quantum HDR refers to TVs with a QLED screen that’s compatible with the HDR technology.”</p><p>As we all know, HDR is used to capture more details and colors in images. So, when used in TVs, it usually affects the color accuracy and contrast ratio in images. Therefore, causing an increase in color accuracy and contrast ratio.</p><p>With the presence of HDR in TVs, bright colors become brighter, and details of pictures become more visible. Yes, it does this by increasing the maximum value for three base colors ‘Red, Green, and Blue’ - this causes colors that originated from the mix of the base colors to be brighter and more saturated.</p><p>Quantum, on the other hand, means a TV uses Quantum Dot technology - a new technology used in TV screens by industry brands like Samsung to capture more details and colors in images.</p><p>Screens made of Quantum Dot technology are also referred to as QLED. Yes, this is because such screens tend to display LED lights that use a unique black light different from other TV screens. So, as a result, TVs with such screens usually have higher brightness and contrast while preserving details of the picture.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-is-Quantum-HDR-16x-24x-32x-40x"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-Quantum-HDR-16x-24x-32x-40x" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What is Quantum HDR 16x, 24x, 32x, 40x?"></a>Part 2: What is Quantum HDR 16x, 24x, 32x, 40x?</h2><p>Quantum HDD 16x, 24x, 32x, and 40x are known as peak brightness multipliers of a TV screen. Although there’s clear information about these peak brightness multipliers at this point, we could tell it’s another marketing strategy relating to how many metadata streams a TV’s processor would process to make the image displayed on its screen more detailed. For example, since the base brightness of a TV is 100 units, a Quantum HDR with a 16x peak brightness multiplier would have a peak brightness of 1,600 units, Quantum HDR with a 24x peak brightness multiplier would be 2,400 units, and so on.</p><p>In all, we could say the overall brightness of a Quantum HDR 16x, 24x, 32x, and 40x increases as the peak brightness multiplier increases.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Is-there-a-difference-between-Quantum-HDR-and-HDR"><a href="#Part-3-Is-there-a-difference-between-Quantum-HDR-and-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Is there a difference between Quantum HDR and HDR?"></a>Part 3: Is there a difference between Quantum HDR and HDR?</h2><p>Even though Quantum HDR is a new technology, a lot of people still mistake it to be the same as HDR.

The intuitive design of TikTok makes it addictive to its users and the simple user interface helps them create video content more conveniently. Thus, TikTok can be called a video editor as well as a social media platform for its global users.</p><p>And one of the main functions of any video editing application is that the user should be able to zoom into videos to showcase specific areas of the video or to make a unique transition. In this article, we are going to learn about face zoom TikTok and how one user can use the Zoom function and make videos with it.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Zoom-on-TikTok-while-creating-a-new-video"><a href="#Part-1-Zoom-on-TikTok-while-creating-a-new-video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Zoom on TikTok while creating a new video"></a>Part 1. Zoom on TikTok while creating a new video</h2><p>With its growing popularity, TikTok has been adding many features to its video editing front. And one of such major functions of TikTok is to zoom the video as per your preference. There are two ways in which a user can zoom the video on TikTok.</p><p>The first one involves zooming in while recording the video and the second one is when you are editing it. And while creating a new video, you are needed to pinch into the screen to zoom your video to zoom in and you can pinch out to do a zoom out. The complete stepwise process is explained below:</p><ul><li>First, open the TikTok application and click on the plus “+” icon that will help you to create a new video. This plus icon is placed at the bottom of the TikTok interface.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-a-new-video-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="create a new video tiktok"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dn-24B6AURY?si=ErES2KWVnintY6h9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>When you tap on the “+” icon, the recording interface will open up. Now, select the duration of the video by tapping the “clock” icon on the left-hand side of the screen. After selecting a set duration, you will find a red shutter button which you will need to hold to start the recording.</li><li>Now, to zoom in on the recording, you can use any of two methods of zooming in. The first method involves you moving your finger up towards the top of your phone from the shutter icon. This will show you a red circle getting bigger.</li><li>Alternatively, you can use one finger to pinch into the screen while holding the shutter icon with another finger and this will ultimately help you achieve a zoom effect on your video.</li><li>For zooming out, you can move your finger towards the shutter button or pinch out and then save the video.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Zoom-an-existing-TikTok-video"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Zoom-an-existing-TikTok-video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How to Zoom an existing TikTok video</h2><p>TikTok is known to provide a vast number of filters as well as editing tools that can create stunning videos with very less effort. And the zoom effect is one of such important functions of video making. If you are new to this then you should know that either you can apply a zoom while creating the video or after recording it. So, for any reason, if you forgot to apply zoom in or zoom out while recording, then you can easily apply this effect while editing it. To zoom TikTok video, you will need to follow these steps:</p><ul><li>First, open any video from your camera roll and upload it to the TikTok application by sharing it to its interface. Alternatively, you can head to the TikTok application and browse your video from the camera roll.</li><li>After uploading the video to the TikTok interface, find the option that says “Visual effects” and then navigate to “Effects”.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/tap-visual-effects-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="tap visual effects tiktok"                ></p><ul><li>Here you will need to find an effect namely the “zoom effect” and tapping on it will apply the effect to your video.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-zoom-effect-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="choose zoom effect tiktok"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xIP8ktrmOdg?si=zRnjbGzM6PDx2jCq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>You can drag the marker of the timeline to set the beginning of the effect on your video.

It is white in color and plastic with sturdy legs to rest on. Two sensors are located on the front and back of the drone and more underneath and to the sides. The camera begins to record on takeoff allowing the drone to find a homing position when ready to return home. The camera hangs below the drone with gimbals that keep it sturdy whatever conditions it is flown in. The arms each have lights so that you can find it easily when in flight.</p><h4 id="Battery-life"><a href="#Battery-life" class="headerlink" title="Battery life"></a>Battery life</h4><p> Underneath the shell of the Phantom 4 is the battery which is high density at 5,870Ah. This allows it to be flown for up to half an hour.</p><h4 id="Sensor-obstacle-avoidance-sensors"><a href="#Sensor-obstacle-avoidance-sensors" class="headerlink" title="Sensor - obstacle avoidance sensors"></a>Sensor - obstacle avoidance sensors</h4><p> The Phantom 4 has a high performance system to avoid objects. The front, back and sides all have sensors which are able to detect potential hazards from around 98 feet with or not they are in front of the drone or behind it. An example of where this would be useful is flying it through a doorway indoors as it is able to go through the doorway without being in danger of crashing into the door frame. Even at 31 miles an hour the avoidance system still works. They do switch off however when you switch to sports mode with increased speed capabilities of 40 miles an hour.</p><h4 id="Flight-performance"><a href="#Flight-performance" class="headerlink" title="Flight performance"></a>Flight performance</h4><p> One of the great features enjoyed by Phantom 4 owners is ‘draw’. This allows users to draw a line on their screen for their drone to follow at the same altitude. You can keep the camera in a forward position or leave it free to move such as in follow mode. The sensors in flight not only detect people in the way but also other objects including cars, bikes and trees. The camera locks to its subject continually while the drone fly’s as set out by the user. The TapFly function allows you to get the drone to go in the direction of where you tapped, by using the TapFly backwards you can make it fly in the opposite direction all while the avoidance system works (except in sports mode). Return to home allows you to get the drone to return to its setting off point easily as it records the route and even chooses the one that is best for the conditions it is being flown in to avoid damage.</p><h4 id="Control-range"><a href="#Control-range" class="headerlink" title="Control range"></a>Control range</h4><p> The Phantom 4 plus comes with a built in screen which has a display screen of 5.5 inches and 1080p. The remote is able to connect to the drone from up to 4.3 miles away and can stream full HD to the display screen. The remote battery can last for up to 5 hours before it needs to be charged.</p><h4 id="Camera"><a href="#Camera" class="headerlink" title="Camera"></a>Camera</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dji-phantom-4-camera.jpg"                      alt="dji phantom 4 review"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qmQjRcnaq9g?si=jadcGtXemUAlKOTa" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The Phantom 4 has been upgraded to include a 20 megapixel sensor which has 12 dynamic range stops which allows for more detailed shots even in intense light. This improves the performance from its predecessor significantly. The mechanical shutter stops the distortion and makes for smoother footage. The 4K video at 60 fps capabilities increase the quality overall giving users better results.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p> The Phantom 4 literally does everything you could need it to. It flies well in all kinds of conditions, reaches great speeds to capture sports play and even avoids objects that would otherwise give users and their drones quite an unhappy ending. As the Phantom 4 is so easy to fly it means that users can concentrate on their footage. With the follow me mode users can literally go hands free and still get great results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6xGqSETroqA?si=4C1GPgXi-AksR_oO" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-launching-into-the-world-of-vlogging/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Launching Into the World of Vlogging</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-finding-clarity-in-colors-top-5-4k-monitors-showcased/"><u>[New] Finding Clarity in Colors Top 5 4K Monitors Showcased</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-boosting-connections-on-snapchat-master-the-art-of-sharing-gifs/"><u>[New] In 2024, Boosting Connections on Snapchat Master the Art of Sharing GIFs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-top-tier-vr-engine-software-a-comprehensive-review/"><u>[New] Top-Tier VR Engine Software A Comprehensive Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-aerial-artistry-essential-steps-for-drone-video-excellence/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Aerial Artistry Essential Steps for Drone Video Excellence</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-chuckle-chest-premium-selection-of-gratuitous-gags/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Chuckle Chest Premium Selection of Gratuitous Gags</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-quadcopters-unveiled-their-intricate-workings-revealed/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Quadcopters Unveiled Their Intricate Workings Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-cutting-edge-design-practices-for-career-advancement/"><u>[Updated] Cutting-Edge Design Practices for Career Advancement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-harness-the-power-of-combining-zoom-with-facebook-live-features-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Harness the Power of Combining Zoom with Facebook Live Features for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/updated-unlocking-flawless-youtube-twitplay-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unlocking Flawless YouTube Twitplay for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/fandangos-guide-to-watching-three-dimensional-movies-on-your-couch/"><u>Fandango's Guide to Watching Three-Dimensional Movies on Your Couch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-phone-with-broken-screen-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 Phone with Broken Screen</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlock-apple-id-without-phone-number-from-iphone-13-pro-max-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Unlock Apple ID without Phone Number From iPhone 13 Pro Max</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/one-voice-many-listeners-a-solo-podcast-blueprint/"><u>One Voice, Many Listeners A Solo Podcast Blueprint</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-hot.techidaily.com/pcdj-techniques-for-music-lovers-unlocking-solo-mode-features-for-singers/"><u>PCDJ Techniques for Music Lovers: Unlocking Solo Mode Features for Singers</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Time-lapse videos are ideal for quickly showing how things develop over a period and are often created when buildings are being constructed, projects are being worked or to show how a scene changes over the course of a day. There are many different apps that you can download to your iPhone to obtain exceptional time-lapse video footage, with effects including Loop, Bounce and Long Exposure.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part1: How to record time-lapse video</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part2: What you need to know before you begin</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part3: Recommended third-party app</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q_69vX9wnRE?si=FtLxkpRhPORqcMeE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part1-How-to-record-time-lapse-video"><a href="#Part1-How-to-record-time-lapse-video" class="headerlink" title="Part1: How to record time-lapse video"></a>Part1: How to record time-lapse video</h2><p>If you wish to record time-lapse video on your iPhone, you will need the most recent version of iOS. For best results and a higher-resolution, use a modern iPhone as these can even offer 4K video at a maximum of 30 frames-per-second. Here are the steps you need to take to get started.</p><ul><li>Open the iPhone Camera app, swiping right or down to get to the Time-Lapse section.</li><li>Tap the Record button to begin recording your video</li><li>Tap again to stop and save the video.</li><li>To find your video, head to the Photos app’s Recently Added, Camera Roll or Video sections.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/time-lapse-iphone.jpg"                      alt="time lapse"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NTQGoOOiJzs?si=zbZwflEfXgBY3qbs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part2-What-you-need-to-know-before-you-begin"><a href="#Part2-What-you-need-to-know-before-you-begin" class="headerlink" title="Part2: What you need to know before you begin"></a>Part2: What you need to know before you begin</h2><p><strong>Shorter time -</strong> It’s usually best to shoot for a long period of time to get the best results. The footage you obtain will be much shorter than the length of time you are shooting for, which means you will need to remain patient to get the best results. You can usually get around 40 seconds of time-lapse footage from a 10-minute session, which means you would need to shoot for around an hour to make a four-minute clip. The reason for this is that the footage is played at a specific number of frames per second, which is substantially more frames than the app you will be using can capture. The number of frames taken per second will depend not only on the app you are using but the settings you choose too.</p><p><strong>Be stable -</strong> Your iPhone also needs to remain as stable as possible so you can prevent camera from motioning and jittering and avoid compromising the quality of the results. If you are able to use a tripod or stand rather than holding your device in your hand, this will be very helpful. Don’t forget to lock the focus, exposure or both before you start recording. You also need to ensure that your iPhone has enough storage space to capture and hold your video. Time-lapse videos can be data-heavy due to the way the feature uses a large buffer and video cache. This is especially important if you are shooting in hi-resolution.</p><h2 id="Part3-Recommended-third-party-app"><a href="#Part3-Recommended-third-party-app" class="headerlink" title="Part3: Recommended third-party app"></a>Part3: Recommended third-party app</h2><p>Though you may find the time-lapse functionality on the iPhone camera satisfactory, you can get much better results by downloading a third-party app. Here are two of the most popular iPhone apps on the market for capturing time-lapse footage.</p><h4 id="1-Lapse-It"><a href="#1-Lapse-It" class="headerlink" title="1.

The former runs on the mobile devices while the later runs with the computers and other gaming devices. There are so many different kinds of products for both these kinds to choose from.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/On0Jw2oMZf0?si=Pm-FJoEt8XWmtMbr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Difference-Between-Mobile-and-Tethered-VR-Headsets"><a href="#Difference-Between-Mobile-and-Tethered-VR-Headsets" class="headerlink" title="Difference Between Mobile and Tethered VR Headsets"></a>Difference Between Mobile and Tethered VR Headsets</h2><p> If we talk about Tethered headsets, we see that they have combined displays, and they usually connect to personal computers or also to game systems using a cable. Whereas on the other hand, mobile headsets typically use smartphones for the display as well as processing; and in the absence of a smartphone, they’re nothing but just shells having lenses.</p><p> Tethered headsets designed to be large, they are expensive, and as well as they are also resource-intensive. They also claim more innovative motion-sensing and head-tracking abilities in opposite to mobile headsets. Other than that, not just the larger headsets consist of extensively devoted motion sensors, they also often work in combination with outside cameras to more exactly track the user’s head. Adding to that, they’re also designed to work with bodily controls, starting from keyboards and gamepads to more exclusive possibilities.</p><p> Now if we talk about the mobile headsets, they are small in size and cheap in price as compared to PC VR Headset. The reason is the most of the work is actually done by the smartphone, so the maximum price of mobile headset could be $100. Most of the mobile headsets are grounded on the Google Cardboard prototype, and with the exclusion of a magnetic switch, they do not have any motorized or electric components in the design; they are only screens with the lenses that divide user’s smartphone’s screen absolutely into two when he holds it to his face.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3Th6oa_isA?si=TTQ013BB9beUM4x6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="When-to-Choose-Mobile-Headset-or-a-VR-Headset-Purchasing-Suggestions"><a href="#When-to-Choose-Mobile-Headset-or-a-VR-Headset-Purchasing-Suggestions" class="headerlink" title="When to Choose Mobile Headset or a VR Headset?

Well, according to their use and qualities both of them are best in some senses and both of them has flaws in some other senses. It all depends on what needs do the user has. Now there are 2 options if you want a headset to try out this new technology and you want this gadget to be always with you wherever you go, you need to buy a mobile VR headset. But in the other case, if you want to completely enjoy this technology with powerful displays and want to have the best experience then there is no doubt you need to buy a tethered VR headset. It also depends on how much money do you have, because the tethered VR headset is very expensive because of its extra functionalities and ruthless display, whereas mobile VR headset are not so much good at display but they are cheap and an average person can easily afford them.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wNhKhWc0wLc?si=1XLYV0sXV52Xc0lu" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Some-of-the-best-of-both-the-worlds"><a href="#Some-of-the-best-of-both-the-worlds" class="headerlink" title="Some of the best of both the worlds"></a>Some of the best of both the worlds</h3><p> LG’s new 360 VR, though, is present someplace in the mid of the best of the mobile headsets. It has its particular lenses and also the display but it is also tethered to the LG G5 mobile with the help of a USB cable. You can regulate things also with buttons present on the HMD or as well as by pushing and long-pressing the display of the smartphone. Audio voice can also come from the headphone jack present on the HMD or through the phone’s earphone port. It is still restricted by the smartphone’s dispensation power but by the presence of its personal lenses, it’s considerably well adapted to virtual reality as compared to Google Cardboard.</p><p> One of the other huge results of a tethered smartphone connection is of the 360 VR is very lighter in weight and debatably more contented than rather like the Gear VR, and it permits for adjustment of the optics. Though it may look awkward, it’s actually not considerably different than the 1st Sony Walkman, which also listed a trivial head gadget which is driven by a tethered device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tPgf_wSdhS8?si=BHoH1ryaxmwk-8FV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-11-innovative-metaverse-projects-for-insightful-analysis-for-2024/"><u>[New] 11 Innovative Metaverse Projects for Insightful Analysis for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-top-notch-visuals-a-cost-free-approach-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unlocking Top-Notch Visuals A Cost-Free Approach for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-10-iphone-virtual-reality-games-to-beat-your-high-scores/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Top 10 iPhone Virtual Reality Games to Beat Your High Scores</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-from-zero-to-hero-solo-podcast-trendsetters-secrets/"><u>[Updated] From Zero to Hero Solo Podcast Trendsetters' Secrets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-ensure-consistent-frame-rates-in-multi-camera-setups-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] How to Ensure Consistent Frame Rates in Multi-Camera Setups for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-quick-and-easy-increase-or-decrease-story-video-speed-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Quick and Easy Increase or Decrease Story Video Speed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/approved-does-instant-subscription-strategy-improve-user-engagement/"><u>2024 Approved Does Instant Subscription Strategy Improve User Engagement?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-blog.techidaily.com/enhanced-user-engagement-with-cookiebot-technology-integration/"><u>Enhanced User Engagement with Cookiebot Technology Integration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://solve-hot.techidaily.com/enhancing-digital-footprints-using-cookiebot-solutions-skyrocket-your-web-visibility/"><u>Enhancing Digital Footprints Using Cookiebot Solutions: Skyrocket Your Web Visibility</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/guide-how-to-unbrick-a-bricked-realme-c53-phone-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Guide How To Unbrick a Bricked Realme C53 Phone | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-extraordinary.techidaily.com/mastering-file-retrieval-uncover-and-save-your-vanished-documents-using-ifinds-data-recovery-software/"><u>Mastering File Retrieval: Uncover and Save Your Vanished Documents Using iFinD's Data Recovery Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/navigating-filmmaker-fascination-filmoras-essential-traits-for-2024/"><u>Navigating Filmmaker Fascination Filmora's Essential Traits for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/transform-your-culinary-skills-with-these-7-tips-for-leveraging-chatgpt/"><u>Transform Your Culinary Skills with These 7 Tips for Leveraging ChatGPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/unlocking-windows-high-dynamic-range-potential/"><u>Unlocking Windows' High Dynamic Range Potential</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Popular platforms linked to the OBS Streamlabs Mac are Twitch, YouTube, Facebook, Mixer, and any other desirable streaming option. The possibilities are limitless. Surely, with this new development, OBS Streamlabs Mac can match close competitors such as the original OBS, ECamm live, and Twitch Studios.</p><p>Subsequently, we will go through the workings of the OBS Streamlabs Mac from download and onwards but, first, it is important to know all about this brilliant Open Broadcast Software and what makes it endearing.</p><h2 id="Streamlabs-OBS-vs-OBS"><a href="#Streamlabs-OBS-vs-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Streamlabs OBS vs OBS"></a>Streamlabs OBS vs OBS</h2><p>The generic OBS is a software put out to the general public to enable streaming in its simplest and unmodified form. For an individual that just wants to stream videos without colorfulness, effects, and additional features, the OBS is perfect.</p><p>However, Streamlabs OBS is improved. Known as SLOBS to its increasing subscribers, Streamlabs OBS enhances user experience and provides a collection of tools to do so in one hub, with no outsourcing.</p><ul><li>OBS (Open Broadcaster Studio)</li></ul><p>It is free and open-source, the code is ‘naked’ to the public. At will, developers can improve on the software. Manual connection to Twitch, YouTube, and the likes is also possible. A few settings here and there and you are set!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/obs-studio.jpg"                      alt="obs studio"                ></p><p>OBS gives a wonderful experience to users albeit with its inefficiencies in providing added features and functions. It is seamless as far as primary recording and broadcasting are concerned, leaving out the extras.</p><p>There are overlays and background designs available on OBS for a price although limited. Largely, users will need to consult other websites—copy and paste—to have varied layout options. It is not much work, however; there are many such websites.</p><ul><li>Streamlabs OBS</li></ul><p>This is an example of when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Streamlabs saw an opportunity with the original OBS and like any other developer, modified it. They have forged on everyone till this OBS Streamlab Mac version. The code was revamped to guarantee an improved user experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/STREAMLABS-OBS.jpg"                      alt="STREAMLABS OBS"                ></p><p>Like OBS, OBS Streamlabs Mac is free with a relatively easier installation process. Preceding the OBS Streamlabs Mac, it was available only on Windows and had app versions on Android and iOS. Notwithstanding, through Bootcamp, Mac owners could switch operating systems and use StreamLabs OBS.</p><p>In a blink, all settings are pre-configured and subscribers are directed to the Dashboard where major choices are made. After a few clicks, you are set to stream.</p><p>OBS Streamlabs Mac’s enhanced experience is by far unmatched by any other of its kind. An array of themes and advanced features allows each user to create his world through personalized—unique—layouts.</p><p>Exclusively, OBS Streamlab Mac provides alerts, text-to-speech automation, widgets, and layouts for free.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n-66V-LRK3Y?si=fNeB2pXCePeQli6E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Steps-to-Download-Streamlabs-OBS-on-Mac"><a href="#Steps-to-Download-Streamlabs-OBS-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Download Streamlabs OBS on Mac"></a>Steps to Download Streamlabs OBS on Mac</h2><p>Here are the easy steps to get OBS Streamlabs Mac working on your computer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LT4sdZgUvRQ?si=SvQD5FouEzu4UHpJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Download-Streamlabs-OBS"><a href="#1-Download-Streamlabs-OBS" class="headerlink" title="1.

Nevertheless, the solutions are clear if the causes are unclear.</p><p>AirPod Pro has been experiencing this issue, but it can happen to any AirPods. They were working fine, and now one of them won’t work when you pop it in your ear.</p><p>The first AirPod we put in our ears tends to cause us to get it by chance. When the other AirPod is inserted, we hear that switched-on chime and know that the issue has recurred. If you face one Airpod not working problem and are looking for possible fixes, you are in the right place. In this article, we will not only guide you on how you can diagnose the problem with your AirPods when one side isn’t working, but we will also tell you some possible fixes using which you can make both your Airpods work again.</p><hr><p><strong>You might be interested in:</strong></p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-call/how-to-facetime-on-android.html" >How to Use Facetime on Android(Everything About Using Facetime Links) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LI9nKlbhnw8?si=uUXFVbuEqXtFHHv0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="One-AirPod-Not-Working-What-Could-Be-The-Reason"><a href="#One-AirPod-Not-Working-What-Could-Be-The-Reason" class="headerlink" title="One AirPod Not Working: What Could Be The Reason?"></a><strong>One AirPod Not Working: What Could Be The Reason?</strong></h2><p>If one side of your AirPods is not working properly, it is a clear indication that something is wrong with your AirPods. If you dig deep into the causes of why this problem occurs, then you will find a range of reasons here. Anything can occur from reasonably simple causes like dirty AirPods and low battery to complex causes like audio settings and network issues. So, now it is clear that the AirPods issue cannot be caused by one single cause, nor can it be fixed by a single solution.</p><h2 id="One-AirPod-Not-Working-What-Could-Be-The-Possible-Fixes"><a href="#One-AirPod-Not-Working-What-Could-Be-The-Possible-Fixes" class="headerlink" title="One AirPod Not Working: What Could Be The Possible Fixes?"></a><strong>One AirPod Not Working: What Could Be The Possible Fixes?</strong></h2><h4 id="1-Check-If-There-is-An-Battery-Issue"><a href="#1-Check-If-There-is-An-Battery-Issue" class="headerlink" title="1.

It is very likely that the not working AirPod is dead, and that’s why it is not working now. When using AirPods, be mindful that the batteries of both sides of Airpods drain at different rates. So, when one side is not working, don’t forget to check your battery widget and charge the AirPods to make them work again.</p><h4 id="2-Clean-Your-AirPods"><a href="#2-Clean-Your-AirPods" class="headerlink" title="2. Clean Your AirPods"></a>2. Clean Your AirPods</h4><p>When you use the AirPods more frequently than it is common to have junk built up in it, it could also be the reason why you do not hear the sound on one side of your AirPods. Dust, Lint, and earwax can form a built-up in your AirPods over time and then can block the sound from getting out of your AirPods. As a result, you think that your AirPods are not working properly. So, there is a very simple fix to this problem. All you need to do is, check the AirPods to see if the speakers look clogged. If you find something clogged in your speakers, then clean them properly and use them again. They will work perfectly.</p><h4 id="3-Turn-Bluetooth-On-and-Off"><a href="#3-Turn-Bluetooth-On-and-Off" class="headerlink" title="3. Turn Bluetooth On and Off"></a>3.

In that case, a very simple fix could be trying to reset the Bluetooth. Just go to the settings in your iPhone or iPad and click on Bluetooth. Turn off the BlueTooth slider from Bluetooth settings and wait for a while. Now turn it back on and check again if the problem is fixed or not.</p><h4 id="4-Restart-Your-Device"><a href="#4-Restart-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="4. Restart Your Device"></a>4. Restart Your Device</h4><p>Despite the lack of certainty that restarting will solve the problem, restarting is straightforward and quick, so it’s worth trying. By restarting a device, the active memory is cleared out, and problems are usually resolved. So you can try restarting your iPad or iPhone if one AirPod is not working. Restarting your device is very simple; all you need to do is, press the power button and then slide from left to right to turn off your device. Once the device is turned off, you can simply turn it back on using the power button.</p><h4 id="5-Unpair-and-Re-pair-AirPods"><a href="#5-Unpair-and-Re-pair-AirPods" class="headerlink" title="5.

You need to set up your AirPods again. You can make AirPods disappear by going to Settings &gt; Bluetooth &gt; tapping i next to the AirPods &gt; Forget This Device &gt; Forget device. By doing so, your AirPods are no longer connected to your device. Next, put the AirPods into the case and hold down the button on the case. Then follow the instructions on the screen to set up the AirPods.</p><h4 id="6-Reset-Network-Settings"><a href="#6-Reset-Network-Settings" class="headerlink" title="6. Reset Network Settings"></a>6.

It could be your settings that are malfunctioning. To reset the Network Settings, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset &gt; Reset Network Settings. You’ll have to re-pair Bluetooth devices, enter Wi-Fi passwords, etc.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YCkNXJjC3c?si=9Tn8KiqKGTZi1o7E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2><p>These are the number of possible fixes that you can try yourself if one or both sides of your AirPods are not working properly.

Ideally, it can be hard to find a GoPro under $100. Even a basic model is priced at $130. While preparing a budget, you must also consider a checklist of supportive accessories and their prices.</p><p><strong>Supportive Accessories:</strong> Though the manufacturers provide some basic gears such as waterproof housing with the camera, it is always necessary to purchase the most compatible high quality accessories that fit your camera best. Some basic requirements include mounts, tripods, filters, extended life batteries etc.</p><p><strong>Camera Specifications and Features:</strong> At the end of the day, your picture or video quality is the main thing that matters. Decide what quality picture resolution or video shooting do you intend to achieve. Consider choosing highest pixel for photos and 4k resolution for best results with final edited video.</p><p><strong>Weather Resistance Protection:</strong> Your action camera is exposed to moisture and fluctuating temperatures often. Your camera should have a waterproof housing or water resistant protection support to ensure greater durability.</p><p><strong>Camera Shape, Dimension and Weight:</strong> The action camera is mostly mounted on the photographer’s body during high-speed mobility. Choose a camera with extremely compact design (preferably box shaped) and lightweight model for convenient mounting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xa2_mFu-obA?si=_xDGF1pv-dnuaDOr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Top-6-Cheapest-Action-Cameras-to-Buy-Under-100-1"><a href="#Top-6-Cheapest-Action-Cameras-to-Buy-Under-100-1" class="headerlink" title="Top 6 Cheapest Action Cameras to Buy Under $100"></a>Top 6 Cheapest Action Cameras to Buy Under $100</h2><h4 id="1-Polaroid-Cube-HD-1080p-Lifestyle-Action-Camera-99-99"><a href="#1-Polaroid-Cube-HD-1080p-Lifestyle-Action-Camera-99-99" class="headerlink" title="1.
