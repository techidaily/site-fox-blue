One of the most interesting things you can include in your videos is a time lapse clip. Time lapses are videos where time seems to rush by quickly. Time lapse videos are often of things like the sun setting or traffic in the city and they are usually created by placing your camera in a stable spot, like on a tripod, and either setting it to record a video or to take pictures at regular intervals.</p><p>A hyperlapse is a special type of time lapse video where the camera changes positions. When you make a time lapse video you leave your camera in one spot. You might set it up in the window of a vehicle or on top of something that moves, but the camera stays in the spot where you mount it. When you create a hyperlapse video you manually move your camera to different positions.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZma8PBO0D8?si=9-qQgGVTuChYd27a" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Make-A-Hyperlapse-Video-1"><a href="#How-to-Make-A-Hyperlapse-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Make A Hyperlapse Video"></a>How to Make A Hyperlapse Video</h2><p>Time lapse videos are everywhere. Television shows often use time lapses and hyperlapses to establish locations. These usually include city skylines or recognizable landmarks. Time lapse and hyperlapse videos have also become popular on YouTube, Instagram, and other social media sites. Often people are creating them on their phones. This article will explain how.</p><h4 id="1-Apps-for-Creating-Hyperlapse-Videos"><a href="#1-Apps-for-Creating-Hyperlapse-Videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Apps for Creating Hyperlapse Videos"></a>1. Apps for Creating Hyperlapse Videos</h4><p>There are several apps for creating time lapse videos, and any of them can be used to create hyperlapses as well. Here are two of the best:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperlapse-hyperlapse.JPG"                      alt="hyperlapse hyperlapse"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QPAKth3O_5c?si=M69YSY0Mk_gsdU0Q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Hyperlapse</strong> is also the name of an app created by Instagram for recording time lapse and hyperlapse videos. This app can record up to 45 minutes of footage and then compress it into a much shorter video. The thing that makes Hyperlapse especially good for hyperlapse videos is that it automatically helps to stabilize the footage you record while walking around. As Hyperlapse is an Instagram app all videos are cropped into square shapes. This app is only available for iOS devices.</p><p>Lapse It is a great app for users who want to have a lot of control over the look of their videos. Besides recording your hyperlapse video Lapse It allows you to do some editing, like trimming your clips or adding music and filters. You can even import hyperlapse videos recorded with other cameras into Lapse It. There is a free version of Lapse It and a ‘Pro’ version which has more features and costs $1.99. Both versions offer in-app purchases. Lapse It is available for both Android and iOS devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hyperlapse-lapseit.JPG"                      alt="hyperlapse lapseit"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-yZKNLxj3po?si=-RbF6nCJEVlHWP-M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>For more information on time lapse apps read the entry ‘Best Apps for Time Lapse Videos’.</p><h4 id="2-Hyperlapse-Videos-–-The-Long-Way"><a href="#2-Hyperlapse-Videos-–-The-Long-Way" class="headerlink" title="2. Hyperlapse Videos – The Long Way"></a>2. Hyperlapse Videos – The Long Way</h4><p>Some video creators prefer to create their hyperlapse videos from photographs they take outside of an app. This takes longer, but some people find it more rewarding. First, choose an interesting location to record your hyperlapse and decide on the path you are going to move along. Look at the frame of your first shot and pick out one detail, like a window on a building. When you move your camera try to keep that detail in the same part of your frame.</p><p>It may be helpful to set your phone up on a tripod or monopod to keep it at the right level and stop it from shaking while you take your photos. You could also place the handle of a selfie stick on the ground and use it as a monopod.</p><p>To create your hyperlapse you will need to take even steps and snap a photo every time you move. You will end up with a huge number of photos which you will need to edit and compile into a video.</p><p>It is a good idea to edit your photos in a program like Lightroom before importing them into a video editing program. In Lightroom you can edit only one image and apply the same specs to the rest.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NTQGoOOiJzs?si=zbZwflEfXgBY3qbs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-from-novice-to-pro-mastering-spotify-advertisement-techniques/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved From Novice to Pro Mastering Spotify Advertisement Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-leaders-list-of-best-12-motion-recording-devices-location-aware/"><u>[New] Leader's List of Best 12 Motion Recording Devices Location Aware</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-unearthing-vivas-video-capabilities/"><u>[New] Unearthing Viva's Video Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/ed-best-free-youtube-intro-makers-to-create-awesome-intros/"><u>[Updated] Best Free YouTube Intro Makers to Create Awesome Intros</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-elevating-your-streaming-experience-switching-between-spotify-and-youtube-music/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Elevating Your Streaming Experience Switching Between Spotify & YouTube Music</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-essential-strategies-for-successful-zoom-meetings-using-win10/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Essential Strategies for Successful Zoom Meetings Using WIN10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-chromatic-soundscapes-selecting-the-right-tune/"><u>2024 Approved Chromatic Soundscapes Selecting the Right Tune</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-revival-device-pack/"><u>2024 Approved Revival Device Pack</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/essential-hashtags-propel-your-posts-to-the-top-for-2024/"><u>Essential #Hashtags Propel Your Posts to the Top for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/in-2024-avoiding-compression-larger-youtube-videos/"><u>In 2024, Avoiding Compression Larger YouTube Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-photos-from-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-pro-5g-to-samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Photos From Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 Pro 5G to Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-pinnacle-cloud-space-for-enterprise-success/"><u>In 2024, Pinnacle Cloud Space for Enterprise Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/mastering-date-and-time-control-in-windows-11-interface/"><u>Mastering Date & Time Control in Windows 11 Interface</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-wins-for-windows-11-users-for-2024/"><u>New Wins for Windows 11 Users for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/prime-fb-video-snatcher-and-upgrades-for-firefox-for-2024/"><u>Prime FB Video Snatcher & Upgrades for FireFox for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-safeguard.techidaily.com/securely-wipe-out-all-iphone-information-from-your-pc-windowsmac-expert-guide/"><u>Securely Wipe Out All iPhone Information From Your PC (Windows/Mac) - Expert Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/top-actions-cameras-reviewed-hero5-vs-yi-in-the-spotlight/"><u>Top Actions Cameras Reviewed Hero5 Vs.

One of the main reasons users find it so useful is the ability to customize the video editing process by adding different kinds of plugins to the program. If you are looking to add unique and fancy text to the video you are working on, then these text plugins for After Effects will come in handy.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="TextDelay"><a href="#TextDelay" class="headerlink" title="TextDelay"></a>TextDelay</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://www.toolfarm.com/buy/plugin%5Feverything%5Ftextdelay/" >https://www.toolfarm.com/buy/plugin%5Feverything%5Ftextdelay/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>TextDelay is a native plugin, meaning that you will find it already installed on After Effects. As the name suggests, you can use TextDelay to delay any other text transformations that you may add to the text and it allows you to delay these transformations by word, line, or even character. It comes with a range selector that allows you to have precise control over which characters can get the effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/text-delay-plugin.jpg"                      alt="text delay plugin"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gSKkJrJ57EA?si=WDOmInPE9EgQa_tB" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="TextExploder"><a href="#TextExploder" class="headerlink" title="TextExploder"></a>TextExploder</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aescripts.com/textexploder/" >https://aescripts.com/textexploder/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>TextExploder is an After Effects plugin that is developed by MamoWorld and it allows you to split the text layers in After Effects into words, lines, characters, and more. These splits are so powerful that you can very easily isolate a single word or even a single letter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/text-exploder-plugin.jpg"                      alt="text exploder plugin"                ></p><h2 id="iExpressions-2"><a href="#iExpressions-2" class="headerlink" title="iExpressions 2"></a>iExpressions 2</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aescripts.com/iexpressions/" >https://aescripts.com/iexpressions/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you want to effectively use the After Effects expressions even if you are not familiar with coding, iExpressions 2 is the text plugin to consider. It comes with 22 ready-to-use iExpressions that you can easily customize to fit into your project and it is so easy to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/iexpression-2-plugin.jpg"                      alt="iexpression 2 plugin"                ></p><h2 id="TextBox"><a href="#TextBox" class="headerlink" title="TextBox"></a>TextBox</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aescripts.com/textbox/" >https://aescripts.com/textbox/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you want to create the perfect shape behind your text, then TextBox is a good text plugin to consider. This is a native After Effects plugin, meaning that you will not need to install it and the shapes it creates can be very easily customized. It updates the shapes you create automatically and adds them to the text layer, making it the most ideal solution to create closed captions, lower thirds, and subtitles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/text-box-plugin.jpg"                      alt="text box plugin"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GBWcw6rXIdg?si=Tlue44bW-bPA4tH9" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Font-Manager"><a href="#Font-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Font Manager"></a>Font Manager</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aescripts.com/font-manager/" >https://aescripts.com/font-manager/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Font Manager is an After Effects text plugin that is useful when creating and working with animated typefaces. You can use it to create the most complex animated text graphics in just a few simple clicks. You will also find it very familiar to use as the user interface is similar to the Character Panel in After Effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/font-manager-plugin.jpg"                      alt="font manager plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Cartoon-Moblur"><a href="#Cartoon-Moblur" class="headerlink" title="Cartoon Moblur"></a>Cartoon Moblur</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://www.toolfarm.com/buy/plugin%5Feverything%5Fcartoon%5Fmoblur" >https://www.toolfarm.com/buy/plugin%5Feverything%5Fcartoon%5Fmoblur <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>This is the most ideal plugin to choose when you want to add motion trail to the graphics in your video, but you want them to appear very cartoony. If you have used the motion blur effect in After Effects, Cartoon Moblur will behave in a similar function, but it is more suited to 2D, flat or minimal graphics. Some of the factors that you can customize include the length of the blur (shutter angle), color, and opacity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/cartoon-moblur-plugin.jpg"                      alt="cartoon moblur plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Shadow-Studio"><a href="#Shadow-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Shadow Studio"></a>Shadow Studio</h2><p>If you are looking for shadow styles that will go very well with your project, Shadow Studio is a good plugin to get. It offers you a wide variety of shadow styles including radial, inner, soft, and long shadows. Most people find it an easier and more affordable way to add soft shadows as compared to traditional methods like raytracing. It is also quite easy to use, meaning that shadow effects that would take hours to complete can be done in a matter of minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/shadow-studio-plugin.jpg"                      alt="shadow studio plugin"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4DJKH1uY7P0?si=tCG66XVlbwSKoATj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Texts-Animation-Bundle"><a href="#Texts-Animation-Bundle" class="headerlink" title="Texts Animation Bundle"></a>Texts Animation Bundle</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aedownload.com/download-texts-animation-bundle-free-videohive/" >https://aedownload.com/download-texts-animation-bundle-free-videohive/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>This is a bundle of more than 80 different templates to add text effects to any text in After Effects.

Retailers are initiating this virtual reality experienced by using focus groups to take customers on various shop along experiences. These shop along experiences involve the use of a guide where the shoppers are all going around and experiencing the same store at the same time. Through this focus group testing retailers are fine-tuning what makes a good online store and a good VR experience for retail shopping.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6kzbT13ds3M?si=hBInu0Or-cX2ANJF" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Development-of-VR-shopping"><a href="#The-Development-of-VR-shopping" class="headerlink" title="The Development of VR shopping"></a>The Development of VR shopping</h2><p> Although VR shopping is still very much in its infancy, this could become one of the more popular ways to shop online. With the rising VR devices as well as the data that retailers are gathering through VR shopping experiences, the process is mutually beneficial. The annual revenue for headsets and VR devices is set to grow over the course of 2016 considerably. Many technology theorists have also speculated that the annual revenue generated by VR devices should grow to 30 billion by the year of 2020. This is a huge boost from a market that is currently sitting at less than $1 billion per year in investment.</p><p> For the future of buying clothing online, retailers could have a huge advantage. Never before has there been a system in which a 3D rendering of a fashion item is created for users to view from every side. This type of individual shopping experience could lead to more satisfied customers as well as an ability to showcase detailed fashion items with their 3D rendered online counterparts. As work is completed in VR tech and user integration, there could eventually come a day where users can eventually start trying on their clothing in virtual-reality online. This would help with a number of issues of fit and function with online clothing retailers.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Bov2KfWQ_Y?si=MnVczisgeJ-sGW2r" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-application-use-scenarios-of-VR-shopping"><a href="#The-application-use-scenarios-of-VR-shopping" class="headerlink" title="The application use scenarios of VR shopping"></a>The application use scenarios of VR shopping</h2><p> In its current form there are a number of big scenarios where VR shopping can deliver a huge advantage over a traditional online shopping experience:</p><ul><li><strong>Presenting the brand</strong></li></ul><p> The full branding for a company would be in place from the marketing signs, music, image of the store and more.

How to live stream with Online OneStream"></a>Part 3. How to live stream with Online OneStream</h2><p>Live streaming with OneStream is pretty straightforward. I will walk you through a series of steps you can follow to live stream using OneStream successfully.</p><p>Step1 First, head to <a class="link"   href="https://app.onestream.live/signup" >OneStream live website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create an account. Just input a username, password, and email address. After that, you need to choose a plan. OneStream offers 4 plans, as I have mentioned above. Just go through the plan features and choose the one that best suits you.</p><p>Step2 After you have successfully picked a plan, on the dashboard, you will see 40 top social platforms, and you will be requested to add your social accounts. If you can’t see the social platform you want to live stream to, you can use custom RTMP to stream it. Except for Instagram, you can connect all of your social accounts directly.</p><p>To connect your Instagram account, you must utilize a third-party software called Instafeed. Instead, it will construct your Instagram account’s Sync URL. Once the URL is generated, please copy and paste it into the OneStream Sync URL section. It will successfully connect your Instagram account to OneStream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/live-stream-with-onestream-1.jpg"                      alt="connect onstream to your social accounts"                ></p><p>Step3 To schedule your live stream on the dashboard, click the “three-line” button.

Then, launch the software and click on the <strong>“Import”</strong> option on the main dashboard to add two Christian music videos to make a custom Christian tone.</p><p>Step2 Drag the video files to the <strong>“Timeline Panel”</strong> at the bottom. Next, right-click the files and select <strong>“Detach Audio”</strong> to extract Christian music audio from videos, which will automatically show on the audio track.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/detach-audio-filmora.PNG"                      alt="detach audio filmora"                ></p><p>Step3 Next up, right-click a particular audio file whose silent parts you want to remove and select <strong>“Silence Detection.”</strong> Here, a window will open up, showing three parameters; <strong>“Threshold,” “Minimum Silence,” and “Buffer,”</strong> which you can adjust using the slider.</p><p>Now, click <strong>“Start”</strong> to initiate automatic silence detection for eliminating all the silent parts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/silence-detection-parameters-filmora.PNG"                      alt="silence detection parameters filmora"                ></p><p>Step4 In this step, emphasize one Christian music file over the other.

Filming Prerequisites for Time Travelling Effects"></a>Part 2. Filming Prerequisites for Time Travelling Effects</h2><p>To create shots, we have to do two processing rounds. In the first round, we will film a shot for daytime activity. While in the next round, we will shoot a video for nighttime activity. Get straight into the filming mode and create according to your script.</p><h3 id="1-daylight-lighting-setup"><a href="#1-daylight-lighting-setup" class="headerlink" title="#1 daylight lighting setup"></a>#1 daylight lighting setup</h3><p>In this round, you have to create a daytime action, implying that you need daylight. As well as, you don’t need professional filming skills because it is going to be so simple.</p><p>Catch us at the below tips to make your video shots more skilled! First, you need a Lightning set, in which blue light is used to film the first shot. Because in this shot, we need daylight, and as you know, blue-ish lighting is usually used to intimate the daylight.</p><p>You can also use a light that is 5,600 kelvins, which indicates blue light. We can easily change the light from its remote, as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/blue-light-lighting-setup.jpg"                      alt="blue light lighting setup"                ></p><p>If you don’t have an asset to get the lighting set up, then don’t worry; we have another option.</p><p><strong>Make colorful shots with plastic binders</strong></p><p>Professional videographers create these effects using high-end lighting. But you don’t have to buy any pricey equipment. Because colored plastic binder dividers or cellophane wrapping can be used to easily create colorful photos.</p><p>First, wrap the colorful divider around the LED light or any other light you’re using to take video. The dividers will be melt or burn when the light source gets too hot; therefore, check the temperature of the light after short gaps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/wrap-the-led-light-with-a-plastic-binder.jpg"                      alt="wrap the led light with a plastic binder"                ></p><ul><li>Shoot the video now, and experiment with adding suspense, terror, and cheerful effects with various colors.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/final-results-after-changing-led-light-by-colorful-binders.jpg"                      alt="final results after changing led light by colorful binders"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FATJWpNYmio?si=72ugPTb3vJXz6cAM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>After setting the lights, now it’s time to check the camera!</p><p><strong>Camera alignment</strong></p><p>It is a very important step that you don’t have to change the camera position during filming. Because if the camera angle will not be same, it’s difficult to show in the same alignment during editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/camera-alignment.gif"                      alt="camera alignment"                ></p><p>After setting all equipment, now it’s time to allow the character to perform in front of the camera.</p><p><strong>Character position</strong></p><p>For the first round, the subject has to do acting for the daytime script. Let the character do their performance according to the screenplay.</p><p>In this article, we are doing a daytime performance in the first round. For this, the subject should go from right to left to step over for night time dimension.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kx-Pb0otJCs?si=Mvr49yQVesmJA8-O" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-night-time-lighting-setup"><a href="#1-night-time-lighting-setup" class="headerlink" title="#1 night-time lighting setup"></a>#1 night-time lighting setup</h3><p>In the second round, you have to create a nighttime action indicating that you need a night light. You have to change the costume of a subject as well as you can change the set too.</p><p>To film a night mode, you need a warmer light, which is used to make shots for the second round. You can also use a light that is under 2700-3000 kelvins because it indicates warm light.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/night-time-warmer-light.jpg"                      alt="night time warmer light"                ></p><p>You don’t need to worry if you don’t have enough budget to get this setup. Because plastic binders will make your way easy, and you can create your own at home, as told earlier.</p><p><strong>Character performance</strong></p><p>For the second round, the subject has to change the costume according to nighttime. Then the character has to perform according to the script.</p><p>In this round, the subject should start from the right to left and perform stepping over to the nighttime dimension. This action should remain on the left side of the crossline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                      alt="note"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure to match the <strong>“stepping over”</strong> of the character for better results in the transition video.</p><h3 id="3-cross-line-between-two-rounds"><a href="#3-cross-line-between-two-rounds" class="headerlink" title="#3 cross line between two rounds"></a>#3 cross line between two rounds</h3><p>For a transition, you have to insert a line between two rounds. It will identify the difference between the two timelines.

In the first round, we will film a shot for daytime activity. While in the next round, we will shoot a video for nighttime activity. Get straight into the filming mode and create according to your script.</p><h3 id="1-daylight-lighting-setup-1"><a href="#1-daylight-lighting-setup-1" class="headerlink" title="#1 daylight lighting setup"></a>#1 daylight lighting setup</h3><p>In this round, you have to create a daytime action, implying that you need daylight. As well as, you don’t need professional filming skills because it is going to be so simple.</p><p>Catch us at the below tips to make your video shots more skilled! First, you need a Lightning set, in which blue light is used to film the first shot. Because in this shot, we need daylight, and as you know, blue-ish lighting is usually used to intimate the daylight.</p><p>You can also use a light that is 5,600 kelvins, which indicates blue light. We can easily change the light from its remote, as shown below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/blue-light-lighting-setup.jpg"                      alt="blue light lighting setup"                ></p><p>If you don’t have an asset to get the lighting set up, then don’t worry; we have another option.</p><p><strong>Make colorful shots with plastic binders</strong></p><p>Professional videographers create these effects using high-end lighting. But you don’t have to buy any pricey equipment. Because colored plastic binder dividers or cellophane wrapping can be used to easily create colorful photos.</p><p>First, wrap the colorful divider around the LED light or any other light you’re using to take video. The dividers will be melt or burn when the light source gets too hot; therefore, check the temperature of the light after short gaps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/wrap-the-led-light-with-a-plastic-binder.jpg"                      alt="wrap the led light with a plastic binder"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RJNYTGHVlLc?si=lhdUUVYMVQjzHXBh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>Shoot the video now, and experiment with adding suspense, terror, and cheerful effects with various colors.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/final-results-after-changing-led-light-by-colorful-binders.jpg"                      alt="final results after changing led light by colorful binders"                ></p><p>After setting the lights, now it’s time to check the camera!</p><p><strong>Camera alignment</strong></p><p>It is a very important step that you don’t have to change the camera position during filming. Because if the camera angle will not be same, it’s difficult to show in the same alignment during editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/camera-alignment.gif"                      alt="camera alignment"                ></p><p>After setting all equipment, now it’s time to allow the character to perform in front of the camera.</p><p><strong>Character position</strong></p><p>For the first round, the subject has to do acting for the daytime script.
