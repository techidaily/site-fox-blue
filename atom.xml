It allows you to remove unwanted backgrounds or objects from an image, change its color, or even create a mask. But many users need help using the Background Eraser tool for their pictures.</p><p>To simplify things, we’ll provide basic information about the eraser tools in Photoshop.</p><p>So, if you are ready to learn how to use the Background Eraser tool in Photoshop, let’s dig in!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Basic-Information-About-Eraser-Tools-In-Photoshop"><a href="#Basic-Information-About-Eraser-Tools-In-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Basic Information About Eraser Tools In Photoshop"></a>Basic Information About Eraser Tools In Photoshop</h2><p>The <strong>eraser tools in Photoshop</strong> can be used to create transparent backgrounds or to remove unwanted background elements from an image. These tools work by sampling the color of the pixels in the image and then erasing pixels that match the sampled color.</p><p>There are three main variations of eraser tools in Photoshop:</p><ul><li>Eraser</li><li>Background Eraser</li><li>Magic Eraser</li></ul><p>Many people need clarification with Photoshop’s Background Eraser and Magic Eraser tools. Therefore, we’ve discussed their similarities and dissimilarities. You can understand them better and so that you can prefer the one that suits your needs:</p><h3 id="Similarities"><a href="#Similarities" class="headerlink" title="Similarities"></a>Similarities</h3><p>The following are the similarities between the Background Eraser and Magic Eraser Tools:</p><p><strong>Erase Pixels Based On Colors:</strong> The Background Eraser tool and Magic Eraser tool can erase pixels based on their color. This means you can select a color, and the tool will erase all the related pixels.</p><p><strong>Destructive Tools:</strong> Both the Background Eraser and Magic Eraser are destructive tools in nature. They delete the pixels you erase. Therefore, you cannot undo or redo your changes once you’ve used either of these tools. However, there are some non-native workarounds to restore your images.</p><h3 id="Dissimilarities"><a href="#Dissimilarities" class="headerlink" title="Dissimilarities"></a>Dissimilarities</h3><p>Here are some dissimilarities between the Background Eraser and Magic Eraser Tools:</p><p><strong>Usage</strong>: To use the Background Eraser tool, you have to hover over the area in your image to erase it based on the pixels you paint over. On the other hand, the Magic Eraser tool instantly erases similar pixels based on your selected color.</p><p><strong>Adjustment Settings</strong>: The Background Eraser offers more adjustment tools than the Magic Eraser. For instance, the former offers Sampling, Limits, Brush size, Tolerance, Angle, and Protect Foreground Color settings, while the latter includes Tolerance, Anto-alias, Contiguous, Sample All Layers, and Opacity options.</p><p>Each tool’s diversity in options significantly affects the final image’s quality. For example, the Magic Eraser Tool erases areas rapidly, though there is limited control over which pixels are deleted.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3koT_-kvbks?si=sQV7FzPiz6GYITrE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Background-Of-Eraser-Tools-Settings-Before-The-Tutorial"><a href="#Background-Of-Eraser-Tools-Settings-Before-The-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Background Of Eraser Tools Settings Before The Tutorial"></a>Background Of Eraser Tools Settings Before The Tutorial</h2><p>Before starting our tutorial on <strong>how to use the Background Eraser tool in Photoshop,</strong> let’s first discuss the adjustment options enabled when selecting the tool and working with them. In this way, you can better understand the steps in the guidance.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/793ViIxl4tI?si=DDBkjPlPX5bZ-f1Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Brush-Preset-Picker"><a href="#1-Brush-Preset-Picker" class="headerlink" title="1. Brush Preset Picker"></a>1. Brush Preset Picker</h3><p>When you enable the Background Eraser tool in Photoshop, you will see that the cursor changes to a brush, indicating that this tool works like other <strong>“Brush Tools.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/bruch-preset-picker-function-in-background-eraser-tool.png"                      alt="bruch preset picker function in background eraser tool"                ></p><p>The <strong>Brush Preset Picker</strong> is the first option that opens up a panel to let you adjust the size of your brush, its hardness, spacing, and tolerance. You can also change the size using the <strong>Left Bracket ( [ )</strong> and <strong>Right Bracket ( ] )</strong>  keys on your PC keyboard.</p><p>To adjust the hardness, press the <strong>“Shift+ Left Bracket”</strong> or <strong>“Shift+Right Bracket”</strong> keys. We recommend that you set it to <strong>100%</strong> when erasing the pixels from your image.</p><h3 id="2-Sampling-Options"><a href="#2-Sampling-Options" class="headerlink" title="2. Sampling Options"></a>2. Sampling Options</h3><p>In the Background Eraser tool’s <strong>Options bar,</strong> you will find the <strong>“Sampling Options”</strong> that includes three different icons with different behaviors:</p><p><strong>Continuous</strong>: This option is selected by default and works best on an image with a colorful background because it removes different pixels as you drag your brush around your picture.</p><p><strong>Once</strong>: If your image’s background does not have many colors, this setting will work best. This is because it removes a single pixel at a time.</p><p><strong>Background Swatch</strong>: You may sometimes have difficulty positioning the crosshair tool precisely over the color you wish to erase. To prevent this, you can use the Background Swatch Option that helps you pick a color and will only erase the activated color from the BG.</p><h3 id="3-Limits"><a href="#3-Limits" class="headerlink" title="3. Limits"></a>3. Limits</h3><p>After you pick a color to erase, the Limits function identifies the location of the pixels that match that color, making it easier for you to erase them precisely.</p><p>The Limit function comes with three options:</p><p><strong>Contiguous:</strong> It’s a default option that erases pixels of the same color touched by the crosshair, which means that it won’t remove any isolated area of pixels located in other image elements.</p><p><strong>Discontiguous:</strong> When you enable the Discontiguous option, Photoshop can erase any pixels in the image that match the sampled color, regardless of whether or not they are touching the crosshair.</p><p><strong>Find Edges:</strong> This setting will come in handy when you find that the edges around your subject are not sharp enough. The Find Edges option works more precisely than the Contiguous and helps to smooth down the sides.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/limits-function-in-background-eraser-tool.png"                      alt="limits function in background eraser tool"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jng92DT1n_Y?si=LvxQhsEJoymsM2iZ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7JBG_O3Vnh4?si=lUO0fta6YPJ50qjg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Tolerance"><a href="#4-Tolerance" class="headerlink" title="4. Tolerance"></a>4. Tolerance</h3><p>Located directly to the right of the Limits function, Tolerance is one of the most important options in Background Eraser, as it signifies how much a pixel’s shade can vary from the sampled color for Photoshop to erase it.</p><p>By default, the Tolerance’s value is set to <strong>50%</strong>. But you should attempt a lower Tolerance setting if your background color is somewhat similar to the subject and Photoshop erases its parts while removing the background.</p><p>If, however, the background color is fringing around the subject, use a higher Tolerance value.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/tolerance-function-in-background-eraser-tool.png"                      alt="tolerance function in background eraser tool"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LaWcXdTn5SE?si=QbxEkX-4a17J5RVs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Brush-Angle"><a href="#5-Brush-Angle" class="headerlink" title="5. Brush Angle"></a>5. Brush Angle</h3><p>The Brush Angle option can help you adjust the angle of your crosshair to quickly erase the pixels in difficult-to-reach areas in your image’s background. You can also hit the <strong>“R”</strong> key on your keyboard to rotate the canvas.</p><h3 id="6-Protect-Foreground-Color"><a href="#6-Protect-Foreground-Color" class="headerlink" title="6. Protect Foreground Color"></a>6. Protect Foreground Color</h3><p>Sometimes, Photoshop erases parts of your subject while removing the background, no matter what Tolerance value you use. To avoid this, the Protected Foreground Color option in the Options bar can come in handy.</p><p>This option allows you to choose a color from your subject as a foreground color, and Photoshop will stop erasing it while you drag the brush over the image to remove the background.</p><h3 id="7-Pen-Pressure"><a href="#7-Pen-Pressure" class="headerlink" title="7. Pen Pressure"></a>7. Pen Pressure</h3><p>Pen Pressure is helpful if you use a drawing tablet instead of a mouse. With this option selected, the crosshair opacity will be regulated based on the pressure applied with your pen on the tablet.</p><h2 id="How-To-Use-Background-Eraser-Tool-To-Erase-An-Image-Background"><a href="#How-To-Use-Background-Eraser-Tool-To-Erase-An-Image-Background" class="headerlink" title="How To Use Background Eraser Tool To Erase An Image Background?"></a>How To Use Background Eraser Tool To Erase An Image Background?</h2><p>The following steps will help you learn how to erase your image background using Photoshop’s Background Eraser tool.</p><p>Step1 In the first step, launch <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html"><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong></a> on your PC and import your image. Then, select the <strong>Background Eraser Tool</strong> in the Toolbar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/using-the-background-eraser-tool-in-photoshop.png"                      alt="using the background eraser tool in photoshop"                ></p><p>Step2 Now, click and drag over the background area you want to erase. Photoshop will automatically select the area you want to erase as you drag.</p><p>Adjust the size and hardness of the eraser brush by using the <strong>Brush Preset Picker</strong> in the <strong>Options bar.</strong> Alternatively, you can also press the <strong>“Right Bracket (]) “</strong> button to increase the size of the brush and the <strong>“Left Bracket ([)”</strong> key to decrease it.</p><p>Step3 In the next step, set the <strong>“Sampling Options”</strong> to <strong>“Once”</strong> and <strong>“Limits”</strong> to <strong>“Contiguous.”</strong> This will help you avoid erasing the wrong pixel color and remove those positioned closer to each other.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/setting-the-sampling-options-and-limits-in-background-eraser-tool.png"                      alt="setting the sampling options and limits in background eraser tool"                ></p><p>However, if the pixels are positioned far apart from each other, you can set the <strong>“Limit”</strong> option to <strong>“Discontiguous.”</strong> While when erasing the pixels around the subject, set the <strong>“Limits”</strong> settings to <strong>“Find Edges”</strong> to ensure smooth edges.</p><p>Step4 If your image background and subject are of the same color and <strong>Photoshop</strong> it removing parts of your subject during the process, set the <strong>Tolerance</strong> to a <strong>low value</strong> by dragging its slider up or down or typing it in the box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/setting-the-tolerance-value-in-background-eraser-tool.png"                      alt="setting the tolerance value in background eraser tool"                ></p><p>Step5 When removing pixels from a background, you can preserve specific pixel colors from being removed, which can be helpful if they are close to the area you want to erase.</p><p>For this, place the cursor on the color you want to keep and press &amp; hold the <strong>ALT</strong> (Windows) or the <strong>Option</strong> key (Mac) until the brush changes to the Eyedropper Tool icon. Then, click the area to sample the color in the <strong>Foreground Swatch.</strong></p><p>This will protect the color, and Photoshop will now avoid erasing it while removing the background. You can repeat the process to preserve other pixels while removing the background.</p><p>Step6 Finally, after removing the background, you can place the subject on another image, a solid color, or export it as PNG with transparent BG.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/exporting-the-final-image-after-erasing-background-with-background-eraser.png"                      alt="exporting the final image after erasing background with background eraser"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n4cc4BSqJls?si=Hkd9vwQDqeCGN7XG" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="You-May-Want-to-Know-The-Working-Process-of-Background-Eraser-Tool"><a href="#You-May-Want-to-Know-The-Working-Process-of-Background-Eraser-Tool" class="headerlink" title="You May Want to Know: The Working Process of Background Eraser Tool"></a>You May Want to Know: The Working Process of Background Eraser Tool</h2><p>Now that you’ve learned <strong>how to use the Background Eraser Tool in Photoshop.</strong> During the process of operating, you might wonder how the software works and changes the BG layer.</p><p>To help you understand this process, we’ll create a sample project (image with pink and blue strips) and show you how the tool works:</p><p>After importing the image, when we check the <strong>“Layers”</strong> panel, we can see that the image is labeled as a <strong>“Background”</strong> layer. So now, we want to erase the pink column and keep the blue one to create a pattern.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/checking-the-image-layer-in-the-layers-panel.png"                      alt="checking the image layer in the layers panel"                ></p><p>When we select the Background Erase tool, the cursor changes to a brush that helps Photoshop to sample the colors that come under the <strong>crosshair (Plus)</strong> in the center of the circle. The circle around the crosshair shows the area where the software will erase the pixels (only the pixels with the same color or shades).</p><p>Now, to remove the pink stripes, we’ll move the brush to that part, and when clicked, the area under the circle will be erased. Notice that even if the circle moves to the blue area, it remains untouched because those pixels are not the same shade&#x2F;color.</p><p>Therefore, as long as we keep the crosshair within the pink area, Photoshop will only erase the pink pixels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/checking-the-working-process-of-photo-shop.png"                      alt="checking the working process of photo shop"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gyGoQi7hsZk?si=8OcKcPUj2wSBmVZ1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>However, if we accidentally erase the blue stripes, we can always go back by simply pressing the <strong>“CTRL+Z”</strong> in Windows and <strong>“Command+Z”</strong> in Mac. To undo multiple steps, hit the <strong>“Ctrl+Alt+Z” (Windows)</strong> or <strong>Command+Option+Z” (Mac)</strong> keys repeatedly.</p><h2 id="Common-FAQs-When-Using-Background-Esarser-Tool-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Common-FAQs-When-Using-Background-Esarser-Tool-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Common FAQs When Using Background Esarser Tool in Photoshop"></a>Common FAQs When Using Background Esarser Tool in Photoshop</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2MlLvGxMwI?si=q_blGjXyJrGtzT8d" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Why-Is-Photoshop-Eraser-Tool-Not-Accessible"><a href="#1-Why-Is-Photoshop-Eraser-Tool-Not-Accessible" class="headerlink" title="1.

VIRB Ultra 30 has been developed with colour LCD screen that can assist users in live preview. The overall dimension of touch screen is 1.75 inch where you can access all photo and video setting icons so easily. But the sad news is that Garmin Ultra 30 is not useful for underwater applications without additional housing. The effective size of Ultra 30 with protective case goes up to 2.3x3.1x1.3 inches whereas overall weight increases up to 5.5 ounces.

Back in the days defining the internet was practically impossible, but people had an idea of what it would bring. However, Metaverse goes hand in hand with the avatar Metaverse.</p><p>As the name Meta suggests, Metaverse refers to a digital reality whose main objective is to blend in virtual reality, augmented reality, social media platforms, cryptocurrencies, and online gaming. Of course, we currently have platforms that feature avatars and virtual identities, but they include one flaw: all these features work on the same platform. This individuality syndrome is what Metaverse wishes to solve.</p><p>In our case, we are discussing the <strong>Metaverse Avatar</strong> and the most straightforward way to create one. Join us as we walk on the journey to creating a Metaverse avatar in the simplest way possible.

When Metaverse Avatar comes about, think of an icon representing you in the VR (Virtual Reality). Therefore, as technical experts talk of Metaverse, an avatar is equally essential. Why? Because it is what you use to identify yourself in the digital world.</p><p>Think of it in the sense of how you go about opening a social media account. Typically, you will upload your photo as a visual representation of yourself on the platform. The same case happens when dealing with Metaverse; you need an avatar.

Start a testing game session after logging in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/login-to-roblox-site.jpg"                      alt="login to roblox site"                ></p><p>Step2Now, all you have to do to zoom in is hit the ‘I’ key on your keyboard, which is located between the ‘U’ and ‘O’ keys.</p><p>Step3If you press or hold this, you’ll probably enter first-person perspective, where you can’t zoom in any more. If you’re already somewhat out of focus, however, you’ll first zoom in toward your character before entering first-person view.</p><p>Step4Simply press the ‘O’ key on your keyboard (the letter between ‘P’ and ‘I’ on a QWERTY keyboard) to zoom out. You may hit “O” as many as you wish or hold it down while you do so to increase the zoom to its highest setting.</p><p>Step5To get the playing zoom level you desire, press “I” and “O” together. You must consequently mix the actions of these two keyboard keys in order to zoom in at the most pleasing scale.</p><h2 id="Way-2-Zoom-In-Out-in-Roblox-with-Mouse-Control"><a href="#Way-2-Zoom-In-Out-in-Roblox-with-Mouse-Control" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Zoom In&#x2F;Out in Roblox with Mouse Control"></a>Way 2. Zoom In&#x2F;Out in Roblox with Mouse Control</h2><p>With over half of all Roblox users being under the age of 16, it is likely that you already know the mouse zooming method. Roblox is one of the most well-known gaming and playing networks for youngsters. To move the camera in all directions, hold down the right mouse button or right mouse click. This control is available in all of Roblox’s games. If your mouse is compatible, you can enable Smart Zoom in the Mouse Preferences and zoom with only a single finger double-tap. You may choose other zoom settings, such as whether to zoom the whole screen or only a portion of it. But you must do certain actions in order to change the camera and mouse sensitivity.</p><p><strong>Steps to Zoom in on Roblox with Mouse</strong></p><p>Step1Go to the Roblox website in your favourite web browser by opening it. Start a testing game session after logging in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/start-testing-game-session-roblox.jpg"                      alt="start testing game session roblox"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vPGg53vbOsk?si=CkSEN5HFPS7vDuAa" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step2Once your gaming session has begun, you may zoom by using the wheel while moving ahead. Once again, if you scroll all the way down, this action will put you in first person perspective. Now all you have to do is use your cursor to scroll ahead to zoom in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-in-with-cursoe-scroll.jpg"                      alt="zoom in with cursoe scroll"                ></p><p>Step3When the game’s map is in your field of vision and you reach the maximum zoom level, just scroll backward with your mouse to zoom out. It will be essential to do the opposite operation, namely scroll the other direction, to zoom out on your character, in order to zoom in.</p><p>Step4In order to play at your selected zoom level, scroll backwards and forth. Because your character will be presented in such tiny type, it will be challenging to play comfortably and see it clearly. Therefore, maintaining balance is crucial in order to have the zoom adjusted to your preferred playing style.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M5pwd2mwaQQ?si=qyZHgdTlbQbc32Mp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Way-3-Use-Xbox-Controller-Thumbsticks-to-Zoom"><a href="#Way-3-Use-Xbox-Controller-Thumbsticks-to-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Way 3.

Use Xbox Controller Thumbsticks to Zoom</h2><p>The amount of mouse usage varies greatly depending on the kind of game being played, with racing games requiring the least amount of mouse use and first-person shooter games requiring the most. Nevertheless, there are several methods to play every game without a mouse. Since the Roblox platform makes it possible to create games, the game’s creator mostly determines the control parameters. In such scenario, you also need a trackpad since using the keyboard could prevent you from accessing some menu options. The good news for Xbox players is that you may do so by using the Thumb sticks.</p><p><strong>Steps to Zoom in on Roblox with Xbox Controller:</strong></p><p>Step1There is a simple and convenient technique to manage the zoom while playing Roblox on the Xbox. Push the R3 button on your controller, which corresponds to the right stick click, to enable the zoom feature. Additionally, you may depress the right thumbstick.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/push-r3-button-controller.jpg"                      alt="push r3 button ontroller"                ></p><p>Step2Zoom in by pressing forward on the right thumbstick that has been clicked down.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/press-forward-right-thumbstick.jpg"                      alt="press forward right thumbstick"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8dH3yHH9IX8?si=geiW5KbIljSFT9pz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step3Pull rearward on the clicked-down right thumbstick to zoom out.

Each game on the internet could have a distinct set of playstyles and strategies. As a result, many new users who play Roblox on a tablet wonder how to zoom in or out. Tablets are handy and portable, but certain text and photos might be difficult to view on the tiny displays. Although there are zooming options on all tablets, you may find yourself scrolling down and swiping more often to access websites. The precise procedure you must use to zoom in and out on your tablet varies on the tablet type, but the following are some key points to keep in mind.</p><p><strong>Steps to Zoom in on Roblox on Tablet</strong></p><p>Step1Open the Roblox app, sign in, and then start a test gaming session. The first is to guide your camera by pressing the right and left directional arrows, however this method is problematic since it involves using the keyboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-in-roblox-teblet.jpg"                      alt="zoom in roblox teblet"                ></p><p>Step2To zoom, just use two fingers and slide them apart (for zooming in) or together (for zooming out) like you would to do so on a smartphone (zoom out).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-roblox-with-fingers.jpg"                      alt="zoom roblox with fingers"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iLlpdv0cz_k?si=HwTdnMmeVJXm4GPV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step3You will be given the best method using the touchpad: while holding down the right side, move the screen to view your character from the front and from behind!</p><p>Step4The camera angle and&#x2F;or your character will only move if one of your fingers, preferably the index, remains steady on the screen. This will prevent the zoom level from changing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-character-on-roblox.jpg"                      alt="zoom character on roblox"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>You may wish to change your viewpoint when playing games on Roblox, the most cutting-edge game creation and sharing platform in the world.

That’s a great idea! Giveaways are a great way to engage with your fans and followers, and they can also help to promote your business.

Knowing the characteristics about aspect ratios is crucial to accomplish the ideal visual appeal across any platform.</p><p>If you want to learn more about video aspect ratios, how to apply them to different social media platforms, then you are in the right place! This article will explain what a video aspect ratio is, it includes common video aspect ratios you see nowadays, and includes recommended aspect ratios for video on various social media platforms.</p><p>With that said, let’s dive right into it!</p><h2 id="1-What-is-a-video-aspect-ratio"><a href="#1-What-is-a-video-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="1. What is a video aspect ratio?"></a>1. What is a video aspect ratio?</h2><p>Aspect ratio is a digital image projection attribute describing the distance between the width and the height of an image. The dimensions are also defined as shapes such as a square which is 4:3. A rectangle represents the 16:9 standard high definition aspect ratio, and inverted what you see on phones, that will be 9:16. 9 refers to the width and 16 to the height.</p><h2 id="2-Commonly-used-aspect-ratios"><a href="#2-Commonly-used-aspect-ratios" class="headerlink" title="2. Commonly used aspect ratios"></a>2. Commonly used aspect ratios</h2><p>There is no same aspect ratio that is used across all social media platforms. Depending on which social media platform you are planning to upload, you have to make sure you have the correct aspect ratio for your target audience. The optimal viewing experience is what matters.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_7AYCS7zBU0?si=7R9oIpE4hyEbtk3x" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="16-9-Widescreen"><a href="#16-9-Widescreen" class="headerlink" title="16:9 Widescreen"></a>16:9 Widescreen</h3><p>This aspect ratio is recognized as the worldwide reference format for film, mobile devides, DSLR cameras, streaming platforms, social media platforms, and many more. It is known as landscape viewing which include 720p, 1080p HD and 4K resolution.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l4R7_qNIQvY?si=2zJOPfEcm6_3udzn" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-3-Standard"><a href="#4-3-Standard" class="headerlink" title="4:3 Standard"></a>4:3 Standard</h3><p>This resolution is originally used in older television screens, which transformed into mobile use as this aspect ratio works really well for Instagram and Facebook videos, referring to the 9:16 phone resolution making a square video more pleasant to watch and to be featured in in-feed videos.</p><h3 id="9-16-Vertical"><a href="#9-16-Vertical" class="headerlink" title="9:16 Vertical"></a>9:16 Vertical</h3><p>The 9:16 aspect ratio has become the mainstream resolution for smartphones for easier viewing of videos. This resolution allows for the vertical display of videos on tablets and phones, meaning that it allows videos to play while the device is being held in its upright position. This works ideally for Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube Shorts, and more.</p><h3 id="21-9-Cinematic-Widescreen"><a href="#21-9-Cinematic-Widescreen" class="headerlink" title="21:9 Cinematic Widescreen"></a>21:9 Cinematic Widescreen</h3><p>The 21:9 resolution is designed for filming ultra-wide screen movies that gives the viewer a theater-like feeling. It’s mostly used to display films and movies in anamorphic formats. Just like on ultra-wide monitors, it allows the video to be shown across the entire screen, giving you a cinema-like experience. This resolution contributes to a broader viewing experience in any shape or form.</p><h2 id="3-Which-aspect-ratio-should-I-choose"><a href="#3-Which-aspect-ratio-should-I-choose" class="headerlink" title="3. Which aspect ratio should I choose?"></a>3.

In order to please new viewers, let’s look at the resolutions Facebook supports and which one would be your best option depending on your content.</p><p>4:3 or 1:1 for Facebook feed videos</p><p>16:9 for in-stream ads on Facebook</p><p>9:16 for Facebook live videos</p><p>9:16 for Facebook stories</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RCYs8keh-Vs?si=uDC28-9yh-k6HLj4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="YouTube"><a href="#YouTube" class="headerlink" title="YouTube"></a>YouTube</h3><p>To this day, it’s safe to say that YouTube is the leading platform in the video industry. Not only because of how long they have been around, but also about how much content is uploaded every minute and how many users it has each month. To give the viewers the best experience, here are the top aspect ratios we recommend when posting content onto your YouTube channel.</p><p>16:9 for YouTube live streams</p><p>9:16 for YouTube Shorts</p><p>16:9 for regular HD videos</p><p>21:9 for cinematic videos&#x2F;shortfilms</p><h3 id="Instagram"><a href="#Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Instagram"></a>Instagram</h3><p>When talking about Instagram, which is very similar to Facebook, use these aspect ratios to ensure that your quality will be the best of the best.</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Reels</p><p>4:3 for Instagram feed advertisements</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Story advertisements</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Stories</p><p>4:3 or 1:1 for Instagram feed videos</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Live streams</p><p>9:16 for IGTV</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9sk53d1bBhY?si=yaTeDogLb3D4dYu1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h3><p>Before Musical.ly users were migrated to a new platform called TikTok in 2018, it has been the leader on the board for a long time, and here are the recommended resolutions we think give the best results. Tik Tok allows you to share short videos, and is used by young people as an outlet to show their talents whether it’s dancing, singing, cooking, comedy or any other form of entertainment they can express and use on the platform. There’s also a feature to work together and collaborate with other Tik Tok creators across the globe.</p><p>16:9 for organic Tik Tok feed videos</p><p>16:9 for Tik Tok live videos</p><p>1:1; 16:9 or 9:16 for TikTok advertisements</p><h2 id="4-How-to-adjust-the-aspect-ratio-of-a-video"><a href="#4-How-to-adjust-the-aspect-ratio-of-a-video" class="headerlink" title="4. How to adjust the aspect ratio of a video?"></a>4. How to adjust the aspect ratio of a video?</h2><p>A very important point we’d like to mention is that we don’t recommend changing the aspect ratio after filming, because it could harm the video quality and we think it’s best to choose the aspect ratio on your phone or camera before filming, besides that we have some great tips for optimizing your video for the watching experience below.</p><h3 id="Black-bars"><a href="#Black-bars" class="headerlink" title="Black bars"></a>Black bars</h3><p>When editing your video, adding black bars is not changing the aspect ratio as you are just adding black bars to the screen. What we do recommend is cropping the video until you get the desired result. Adding black bars won’t automatically make the platform adjust the video and it will affect the viewer experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4q6gyaEojM?si=ImdFm6Zsr0azykqV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Cropping"><a href="#Cropping" class="headerlink" title="Cropping"></a>Cropping</h3><p>Cropping your video will allow you to remove a section from your video, which works perfect for unwanted objects or people. While cropping the video, you are forced to pick the essential part of your video and disregard the rest of the video and to remove distraction from the frame.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Having your video tested on multiple devices will allow you to see a preview of what the viewer will see and make necessary changes if needed. When your video looks perfect, you can be sure that it will give a seamless experience across all platforms, without the fear of losing video quality.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p></article[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)For macOS 10.14 or later<p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-enter-the-world-of-games-with-a-single-funimate-apk-download/"><u>[New] Enter the World of Games with a Single Funimate APK Download</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-guide-to-scrolling-through-youtube-comment-threads/"><u>[New] Guide to Scrolling Through YouTube Comment Threads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-elite-camera-selection-the-1-to-18-for-stunning-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, Elite Camera Selection - The #1 to #18 for Stunning Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-essential-techniques-recording-live-tv-online/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Essential Techniques Recording Live TV Online</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/updated-achieve-high-definition-quality-with-video-enhancer-22-tutorial/"><u>[Updated] Achieve High-Definition Quality with Video Enhancer 2.2 Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-use-luts-from-color-grading-central-to-color-grading-for-movies/"><u>[Updated] How to Use Luts From Color Grading Central to Color Grading for Movies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-hustle-smart-listen-hard-top-tasks-for-podcast-enthusiasts-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Hustle Smart, Listen Hard Top Tasks for Podcast Enthusiasts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-reliable-strategy-to-infuse-direct-urls-in-tiktok-bio-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Reliable Strategy to Infuse Direct URLs in TikTok Bio for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-the-essential-beginning-lineups-for-panzoids-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Essential Beginning Lineups for Panzoids for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-guide-to-stunning-pixel-perfect-combinations/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Guide to Stunning Pixel-Perfect Combinations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-making.techidaily.com/windowsssdssd/"><u>在不同版本的Windows中，如何将系统文件从现有SSD复制到新SSD？</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/a-detailed-vpna-fake-gps-location-free-review-on-tecno-pop-8-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>A Detailed VPNa Fake GPS Location Free Review On Tecno Pop 8 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/from-novice-to-leader-mastering-social-media-marketing-smm-in-10-steps-for-2024/"><u>From Novice to Leader Mastering Social Media Marketing (SMM) in 10 Steps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/here-are-some-pro-tips-for-pokemon-go-pvp-battles-on-apple-iphone-6-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Here are Some Pro Tips for Pokemon Go PvP Battles On Apple iPhone 6 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://program-issues.techidaily.com/if-switching-entirely-begin-with-a-gradual-transition-rather-than-an-abrupt-change/"><u>If Switching Entirely, Begin with a Gradual Transition Rather than an Abrupt Change.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/top-5-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-4g-bypass-frp-tools-for-pc-that-actually-work-by-drfone-android/"><u>Top 5 Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 4G Bypass FRP Tools for PC That Actually Work</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
