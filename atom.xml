    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Top-6-Social-Media-Outlets-Boosting-Business-Revenue"><a href="#Top-6-Social-Media-Outlets-Boosting-Business-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Top 6 Social Media Outlets Boosting Business Revenue"></a>Top 6 Social Media Outlets Boosting Business Revenue</h2><p>Social media is a great way of promoting your business. With so many platforms, it can be hard to know which ones to use, so here’s a guide to some of the best social media platforms for business.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/business-social-media-platforms.jpg"                      alt="business social media platforms"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h2><p>TikTok is a video-sharing platform. It’s the most popular video-sharing platform in the world and has 30.8 Million daily active users. TikTok was founded by Zhang Yiming, who also founded Byte Dance, which owns TikTok. TikTok is based in Beijing, China, and was launched in September 2016.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/tiktok-app.jpg"                      alt="tiktok app"                ></p><p>It’s great for promoting your business with short, engaging videos. You can use TikTok to show off your products, give behind-the-scenes looks at your business, or even just tell your brand story. You can also use TikTok to run ads.</p><h2 id="Facebook"><a href="#Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Facebook"></a>Facebook</h2><p>Facebook currently has 1.908 billion daily active users, giving it a huge audience to reach customers. Facebook also has a lot of information about its users, which means they can target their ads more effectively than other platforms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/facebook-app.jpg"                      alt="facebook app"                ></p><p>Facebook’s advertising options are extensive and include Pros and Cons:</p><p>Advantages include being able to show your product at different stages in its lifecycle (e.g., pre-order vs. purchase); being able to target what kind of consumer you want; and having access to analytics that allow you to see how well your ads are performing (i.e., number of clicks&#x2F;impression).</p><p>Disadvantages include not knowing if people are going directly from clicking on an ad and buying something else online instead; not being able to tell if someone who saw an ad might have come back later to buy something from you instead, or spending too much money on ads without seeing results immediately (the latter is one reason why some businesses don’t like using Facebook as much).</p><h2 id="Twitter"><a href="#Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Twitter"></a>Twitter</h2><p>Twitter, the platform that started off as a way for people to share their thoughts up to 280 characters or less, has become much more than that. It is a great way to communicate with your customers and it can also help make your brand stand out. Twitter allows you to engage with potential customers and get feedback from them about what they think of your product or service.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/twitter-app.jpg"                      alt="twitter app"                ></p><p>If you want customer service feedback in real-time then Twitter is probably one of the best ways to do it because users are always on their phones looking at social media throughout the day. Also, Twitter is one of the easiest platforms to use so if someone needs help they can easily get it by tweeting someone who works there directly.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111965/7443" target="_top" id="2111965">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111965" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111965/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="YouTube"><a href="#YouTube" class="headerlink" title="YouTube"></a>YouTube</h2><p>There are plenty of reasons why YouTube is a great platform for business. Here are some of them:</p><p>You can create and share content. If you want to start sharing your knowledge with the world, then this is a good place to start. The only thing you need is a camera and an internet connection!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/youtube-app.jpg"                      alt="youtube app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068408/7443" target="_top" id="2068408">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068408" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068408/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>It’s a great place to connect with people who have similar interests as you do, or even just connect with people in general (if what they’re interested in has something to do with your field).</p><p>You can learn things too! There are tons of tutorials available on YouTube that will teach any skill imaginable - everything from learning how to play guitar or speak Spanish, all the way up through creating entire websites from scratch (which may be more than some people want). If there’s something specific that interests me personally then I know I’ll probably find it there somewhere because there are millions upon millions of videos uploaded every day by millions upon millions of different people worldwide.”</p><h2 id="Instagram"><a href="#Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Instagram"></a>Instagram</h2><p>Instagram is a visual platform, so it’s no surprise that it’s one of the best social media platforms for business. Not only can you use Instagram to promote your brand and products, but it also allows you to build customer engagement and build a community around your brand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/instagram-app.jpg"                      alt="instagram app"                ></p><p>Instagram also has the advantage of being owned by Facebook, which means that you can easily transfer followers from Instagram onto Facebook.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977006">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977006.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977006">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977006.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977006%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977006/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="LinkedIn"><a href="#LinkedIn" class="headerlink" title="LinkedIn"></a>LinkedIn</h2><p>LinkedIn is a social media platform that is designed for business networking.

This is because LinkedIn users are generally more engaged than users of other social media platforms, and they’re more likely to read and share content that is interesting and relevant to their industry.</p><p>One disadvantage of LinkedIn is that it can be difficult to stand out from the crowd if you’re not a large or well-known company. This is because there are already so many businesses on LinkedIn, and many of them are already well-established.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043856/7443" target="_top" id="2043856">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043856" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043856/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, what’s the best social media platform for your business?

For informative videos, the style of font decides the tone in which the texts are displayed.</p><p>Thus, selecting a proper font for the video becomes necessary in the post-production process.

And if you are wondering <strong>how to add font in After effects</strong> to your video, then you can follow these steps:</p><ul><li>For adding the Adobe Fonts to After Effects, you will first need to enable them by signing in to the Creative Cloud application on your desktop. To do that, first, open the Creative Cloud, navigate to Assets, and click on Fonts.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/enable-fonts-adobe-after-effects.jpg"                      alt="enable fonts adobe after effects"                ></p><ul><li>This will direct you to the official website of Adobe Fonts where you can enable the fonts for your After Effects application.

Yes, you don’t require technical knowledge or any third-party software for such an operation. All it takes is just a few clicks.</p><p>That being said, keep in mind that before you start creating SRT subtitles for your video, you must have reviewed your video and have a copy of the audio&#x2F;dialogue that you want to use as a caption in the SRT file. This will prevent you from making errors during the SRT creation process.</p><p>The stepwise guide illustrated below will walk you through how to create an SRT file for video in Windows;</p><p>Step1 Start your Windows computer and open the Notepad program. Then create a new file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-1.jpg"                      alt="create a new file"                ></p><p>Step2 Up next, play your video and listen to the first line of the dialogue. Then pause it and write your first subtitle in the note by doing the following;</p><ul><li>Type 1 &gt; under it, write the first Timestamp. The timestamp should be written in hours:minutes: seconds, milliseconds format as shown below;</li></ul><p><em>1</em></p><ul><li><em>00:00:07,114 –&gt; 00:00:11,834</em></li></ul><p>The times displayed indicate the beginning and end of when the subtitle appears on the viewer’s screen. Ensure to make this time as accurate as possible.</p><p>Step3 Move to the next line and type your subtitle content - the text that will show on the screen. This should be one or two sentences. Long texts should be broken into multiple subtitles to make them easy for viewers to understand.</p><p>Step4 Repeat steps 2&amp;3 for the remaining subtitle contents.</p><p>Below is an example of what an SRT subtitle should look like;</p><p><em>1</em></p><p><em>00:00:07,114 –&gt; 00:00:11,834</em></p><p><em>Hello, and welcome to our presentation.</em></p><p><em>2</em></p><p><em>00:00:012,108 –&gt; 00:00:16,357</em></p><p><em>In this video, we’ll be showing</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-for-video-on-windows-1.jpg"                      alt="an example of an srt subtitle"                ></p><p>Step5 Review the subtitle and edit every error after you’ve completed it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-for-video-on-windows-2.jpg"                      alt="review subtitle"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896527/19272" target="_top" id="1896527">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896527" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896527/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step6 Finally, save the file in .srt format by clicking <strong>‘File’ &gt; Save.</strong> Then under <strong>‘Save As’</strong> enter the file name and add .srt as the preferred extension for your file.

Yes, you don’t require technical knowledge or any third-party software for such an operation. All it takes is just a few clicks.</p><p>That being said, keep in mind that before you start creating SRT subtitles for your video, you must have reviewed your video and have a copy of the audio&#x2F;dialogue that you want to use as a caption in the SRT file. This will prevent you from making errors during the SRT creation process.</p><p>The stepwise guide illustrated below will walk you through how to create an SRT file for video in Windows;</p><p>Step1 Start your Windows computer and open the Notepad program.

Ensure to make this time as accurate as possible.</p><p>Step3 Move to the next line and type your subtitle content - the text that will show on the screen. This should be one or two sentences.

It has never been easier to start an online business and succeed.</p><p>There are plenty of ways to do this. But Reddit marketing is proving to be among the most promising ones. Reddit is a platform where communities of over 1.5 billion users in total gather every month.</p><p>Using the right Reddit marketing strategy can result in more sales, clients, and traffic. This guide will be your crash course on how to do Reddit marketing. Expect tons of actionable tips that will help you succeed faster.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-Does-Reddit-Work"><a href="#Part-1-How-Does-Reddit-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How Does Reddit Work?"></a>Part 1. How Does Reddit Work?</h2><p>Reddit is a place for gathering. It’s where communities of all interests can connect and share ideas, knowledge, experiences, and more.</p><p>The rules of Reddit are simple.</p><p><strong>Upvotes &amp; Downvotes</strong></p><p>First, there are Upvotes and Downvotes. This determines which posts go on top and which ones get buried down below. The more Upvotes a post has, the more it will be seen. The more Downvotes it has, the more irrelevant it becomes.</p><p><strong>SubReddits</strong></p><p>Subreddits are communities within Reddit. Each subreddit is dedicated to a topic. For example, there are subreddits about food, gaming, and finance…… you name it!</p><p>Each subreddit has its members. Some have hundreds of thousands of members, while other subreddits only have a couple of hundred or fewer.</p><p>The idea behind them is to make Reddit a more organized place where you can easily find what you’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Content and Posting</strong></p><p>The most important part of Reddit is the posts. What you post can have a significant impact on whether you reach a vast audience or not.</p><p>Ideally, posting valuable advice that will genuinely help someone out works best. However, you can also post entertaining content, personal experiences, and more.</p><p>You’ll be fine if it doesn’t go against Reddit’s guidelines.</p><p><strong>Reddit Karma</strong></p><p>Last but not least, Reddit Karma is another crucial feature. It is a status symbol. It reflects how much you contribute to each Reddit community. The more Karma you have, the more authority and value your actions on Reddit have.</p><p>You can earn more Reddit karma by receiving Upvotes on your posts and comments.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080317/19272" target="_top" id="2080317">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080317" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080317/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-You-Do-Reddit-Marketing"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-You-Do-Reddit-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Let’s look at some facts.</p><ul><li>Reddit currently gets <strong>1.7 billion</strong>monthly users</li><li>It is ranked <strong>#19</strong>out of all the other sites on the internet globally</li><li>It is also ranked <strong>#12</strong>among all the websites in the United States</li></ul><p>All this means is that you have billions of potential customers to reach on Reddit each month. As a result, it may be the perfect platform for you to market your business and achieve amazing results.</p><p>There are even more good news and reasons to attempt a Reddit marketing strategy for your business.</p><p>Reddit has a somewhat unique audience. Close to <strong>50%</strong> of Reddit users don’t use Instagram. A higher percentage than this don’t use TikTok as well. Additionally, <strong>90%</strong> of Reddit users go there to learn about new products and brands.</p><p>That is an excellent opportunity to use Reddit marketing for your business. It’s literally where people go to learn more about your business.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Market-on-Reddit-5-Actionable-Ways"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Market-on-Reddit-5-Actionable-Ways" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

To get good results, your content MUST help the reader in some way. Find out what your audience’s problems are and pour your heart and soul into finding a solution for them.</p><p>It will be worth it in the long run.</p><p><strong>Be Consistent and Persistent</strong></p><p>Doing one Reddit post, no matter how good it may be, will rarely do the trick. The key to creating any type of content is consistency and value.</p><p>There are three major reasons why this is crucial:</p><p>- It builds trust among your audience. This makes it easier to sell to them later</p><p>- Adds a lot to your credibility. The more you increase your credibility, the easier it is to sell to new viewers</p><p>- It gets more eyes on you. The more content you post, the more potential customers you acquire</p><p><strong>Listen to Feedback and Host AMAs</strong></p><p>AMA stands for “Ask Me Anything”. This offers a perfect opportunity for you to connect with your audience. It lets you find out more about them. This is crucial information that will help you increase your sales and make more money in the long run.</p><p>Feedback is very important for a growing business. It’s a simple way to research your audience. Remember, the more you know about their fears, issues, attractions, and similar… the more you can improve your brand and meet their demands.</p><p>Reddit has its own<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/" >AMA subreddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It currently has over 22 million members. Here, you can post who you are and what you do. Then, expect plenty of questions from your audience.</p><p><strong>Always Support Your Audience</strong></p><p>Making money is great. But, always promoting your business and talking about yourself will never bring good results. The key is to put your audience in front.</p><p>You need to care about your customers. Talk to them, offer free advice, listen to their needs, and engage more with them. The more you put their interests ahead of your own, the better the impact on your business.</p><p>For example, when a user asked “<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1fel08/what%5Fcompany%5Fhas%5Fsuch%5Fgood%5Fcustomer%5Fservice%5Fthat/" >What company has such good customer service that every other company should aspire to? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“, the comments were overflooded with the word “Amazon”.</p><p><strong>Advertise on Reddit</strong></p><p>There are two types of Reddit ads you need to be doing:</p><ul><li>Takeover Ads</li><li>Promoted Ads</li></ul><p>To be successful with your Reddit marketing strategy, you must know how to run ads.</p><p>The first step is to go over as many<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddiquette.com/reddit-ad-examples/" >examples of successful Reddit marketing campaigns <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as you can.</p><p>Second, you must familiarize yourself with<a class="link"   href="https://redditinc.force.com/helpcenter/s/article/Reddit-Advertising-Policy-Overview" >Reddit’s advertising policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Make sure you’re not creating an ad that goes against their rules.</p><p>Lastly, have a clear objective. Know why you’re creating your ad. Is it to increase your audience? Is it to get more sales? Is there another reason?</p><p>Knowing all of this will significantly improve your results and also give you insights on what type of Reddit ad to create. And now, you know how to market on Reddit. So, go out there and make this happen.</p><h2 id="Part-4-A-Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Video-Editor-for-Reddit"><a href="#Part-4-A-Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Video-Editor-for-Reddit" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Because many smartphones nowadays offer the best picture quality when it comes to snapping photos using their camera, it is imperative to learn <strong>how to blur a picture on iPhone</strong> so the main subject grabs the limelight, hence making the other objects in the background get the least focus.</p><p>That said, when it is said <strong>how to blur photos on iPhone</strong>, it practically means that you are learning the process of blurring the background so the main subject (a person or an object) gets the most attention, and that’s what is explained in the following sections.</p><p>There are multiple ways to get this done. For instance, the background of the photos can be blurred while shooting even on the older iPhones. Likewise, if you already have an image, you can use the Photos app’s built-in effects, or download a third-party program to get the job done.

Next, tap anywhere on the screen to import the selected picture to Snapseed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-photo-to-blur-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="open photo to blur snapseed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Pick the Blur Tool</strong></p><p>Tap <strong>TOOLS</strong> from the bottom of the interface, and from the options available in the box that pops up, tap <strong>Lens Blur</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pick-blur-tool-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="pick blur tool snapseed"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Adjust the Blur Shape and Size</strong></p><p>Tap the <strong>Shape</strong> icon from the bottom to switch between the <strong>Linear</strong> and <strong>Elliptical</strong> blur shapes. Tap the Blue dot at the center of the image, and drag it to the main subject in the photo. Next, use two fingers to drag inwards or outwards on the screen to decrease or increase the effective area respectively.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Blur the Photo and Export</strong></p><p>From the top, ensure that the <strong>Blur Strength</strong> option is selected, tap anywhere on the screen, and drag to the right to increase the intensity of the blurriness. Optionally, you can tap the Effect Types icon from the bottom, and tap to choose <strong>Vignette Strength</strong> from the box that comes up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/snapseed-blur-photo-background.jpg"                      alt="snapseed blur photo background"                ></p><p>Then, as earlier, drag your finger to the right or left anywhere on the screen to increase or decrease the intensity of the effect respectively. Once done, tap the <strong>OK</strong> button (with the tick mark) from the bottom-right corner. Back on the main screen, tap <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right, you tap your preferred option for exporting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-blurred-photo-snapseed.jpg"                      alt="save blurred photo snapseed"                ></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Blurring the background in a photo ensures that the main subject remains in the focus, and all the other unimportant objects don’t steal the limelight. If you are using iPhone 7 Plus or above models, the background of the photos can be blurred at the time of capturing. Furthermore, the built-in Photos app in iPhones also come with the Vignette effect that enables you to do the job with ease. However, if you want precision and more control over the images while blurring, you can use an efficient third-party tool like Snapseed that also has its own set of tutorials to teach <strong>how to blur a picture on iPhone</strong>.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unleash-the-potential-of-pip-in-microsoft-edge-browser/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Unleash the Potential of PIP in Microsoft Edge Browser</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-expert-picks-top-10-budget-friendly-jpeg-to-gif-apps/"><u>[New] Expert Picks Top 10 Budget-Friendly JPEG to GIF Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-instant-animation-from-youtube-videos-to-compelling-gifs/"><u>[New] Instant Animation From YouTube Videos to Compelling GIFs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-top-picks-for-the-best-android-image-correction-tools-5-choices/"><u>[New] Top Picks for the Best Android Image Correction Tools (5 Choices)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-expert-ai-visualization-toolset-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Expert AI Visualization Toolset for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-premium-sound-on-a-dime-top-value-asmr-gear-uncovered-here-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Premium Sound on a Dime Top Value ASMR Gear Uncovered Here for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-revolutionizing-visuals-the-impact-of-usb-c-and-4k-on-hps-envy-27-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Revolutionizing Visuals The Impact of USB-C & 4K on HP's Envy 27 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-voice-transformation-tools-magic-edition-highlighted-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Voice Transformation Tools Magic Edition Highlighted for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlocking-zooms-potential-learn-how-to-use-video-filters/"><u>2024 Approved Unlocking Zoom's Potential Learn How to Use Video Filters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/60-nombres-de-fauna-espanhola-que-debes-saber/"><u>60 Nombres De Fauna Espanhola Que Debes Saber</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-timestamps-in-video-sharing-for-2024/"><u>A Step-by-Step Guide to Timestamps in Video Sharing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://network-issues.techidaily.com/fixing-the-flipped-display-problem/"><u>Fixing the Flipped Display Problem</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-any-lava-yuva-3-pro-phone-password-using-emergency-call-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Unlock Any Lava Yuva 3 Pro Phone Password Using Emergency Call</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-compreenas-guide-for-efficient-pip-integration-in-edge-browser/"><u>In 2024, A Compreenas Guide for Efficient PIP Integration in Edge Browser</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-by-step-tutorial-for-building-movies-on-windows-8/"><u>In 2024, Step-by-Step Tutorial for Building Movies on Windows 8</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/ls-0013-bug-in-fortnite-now-fixed-detailed-guide-inside/"><u>LS-0013 Bug in Fortnite Now Fixed – Detailed Guide Inside</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/symbolizing-success-crafting-effective-podcast-logos-for-2024/"><u>Symbolizing Success Crafting Effective Podcast Logos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/twelve-south-compass-pro-gadget-analysis-optimized-design-ensures-ultimate-balance/"><u>Twelve South Compass Pro Gadget Analysis: Optimized Design Ensures Ultimate Balance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/undelete-lost-messages-from-xiaomi-redmi-note-12r-by-fonelab-android-recover-messages/"><u>Undelete lost messages from Xiaomi Redmi Note 12R</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The Yi 4k action cam appears more trendy and sleek with its smooth plastic finish and the attractive rounded corners. Whereas, SJ6 has a rugged appearance with rubberized material that provides textured finish with added grip. You will also find few indicating LEDs on SJ6 body.</p><p> Yi Action cam is designed with a 2.19” LCD screen but SJ6 has little smaller up to 2” only. You will find MicroSD and MicroUSB slots on Yi’s body but in case of SJ6, MiniUSB, MicroSD and Micro HDMI make connectivity much easier. Another difference lies in their buttons as Yi 4K has only on button on its body but you will find 3 control buttons on SJ6 Legend.</p><h4 id="Accessories"><a href="#Accessories" class="headerlink" title="Accessories"></a>Accessories</h4><p> Second noticeable difference is in accessories of both action cam units. Note that, both of these companies are offering cameras with threaded tripod type hole on bottom side of their body so that users can easily attach them to mounts. But you will find more flexibility with SJ6 as its box includes all necessary mounts that can meet action recording needs with ease. On the other side, Yi 4K box does not even offer a waterproof case to buyers. You have to make all the expenses yourself to fulfill your needs. You will find so many expensive combos for Yi accessories over online stores.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >More Accessories You May Need <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="Battery-Life"><a href="#Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life"></a>Battery Life</h4><p> In this case, Yi 4K action cam wins the battle with its ability to record 4k videos tirelessly up to 120 minutes with 30fps setting. For SJ6 legend, you will be able to enjoy maximum recording time up to 70 minutes with 4K settings at 25 fps. It is essential to keep Wi-Fi and screen off to gain this much performance from SJ6 otherwise you will find faster decay in battery percentage. Yi 4k battery is designed with fine tuned advanced power management system that leads to higher service capacity.</p><h4 id="Waterproof"><a href="#Waterproof" class="headerlink" title="Waterproof"></a>Waterproof</h4><p> If you are a underwater adventure lover then Yi 4K cannot provide your more satisfactory service because it can go underwater up to 40 meters and this dive is not possible without protective case. The sad part is that the camera box doesn’t include case so you have to make additional payment to buy it. SJ6 legend is designed to offer impressive underwater performance with its ability to go underwater up to 30 meters with ease and a sturdy, sleek, well designed waterproof case is included in its package.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/798165/11305" target="_top" id="798165">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-798165" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i110150.net/i/5597632/798165/11305"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Features-and-Performance-Comparison"><a href="#Features-and-Performance-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance Comparison"></a>Features and Performance Comparison</h2><h4 id="Video-and-Image-Quality"><a href="#Video-and-Image-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Video and Image Quality"></a>Video and Image Quality</h4><p> When we moved to the video quality test then Yi 4K offered quite appealing results. This camera is designed with native 4k resolution so that crystal clear footage can be recorded with impressive results. But in case of SJ6 you will find interpolated 4K technology; it means that your device actually captures all details in 2K resolution mode but the final footage get produced with 4K result where additional 2K is increased with addition of fake pixels during processing. The image quality with such interpolated system goes really bad. But if you compare performance of both devices at Full HD 1080p resolution level then you will be able to find impressive quality with Yi cam and it also provides support to 120fps frame rate at 1080p.</p><h4 id="Audio-Quality"><a href="#Audio-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality"></a>Audio Quality</h4><p> You will be glad to know that Yi 4K action cam support 360 degree omni directional coverage with microphones and it also has powerful built in speakers.

These screenplays may be original or modified from previously published material. They also describe the characters’ movements, actions, expressions, and dialogues. A teleplay is a screenplay written specifically for television.</p><p>A screenplay is a <strong>written text that serves as the foundation for film production</strong>. It usually includes not only the characters’ dialogue but also a shot-by-shot outline of the film’s action. This article will cover everything you need to know about screenplays.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-screenplay"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-screenplay" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is a screenplay?"></a>Part 1. What is a screenplay?</h2><p>A screenplay is a piece of writing that contains the dialogue for an entire film or television episode.</p><p>A screenplay can be based on original material, such as screenwriter ideas, or on pre-existing works, such as novels. The text is mostly dialogue, with descriptions of the environment, locations, scenery, costumes, and characters thrown in for good measure.</p><p>It can be used to ensure that everything in your story is consistent with what you’ve shot. It can also be used to assist with editing!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-1.jpg"                      alt="a screenplay"                ></p><p>A screenplay is a script for a film, television show, or play. It tells a story by using dialogue and action to show how the scenes are connected.</p><p>Are you considering writing a screenplay?</p><p>Are you wondering if it’s worth it?</p><p>This article will provide answers to your questions as well as resources to help you get started!</p><p>A screenplay is a story that describes what will be seen on film or television. They are written in a script format, which differs from novel writing.</p><p>The structure of a screenplay can differ depending on the type of film being produced and the amount of dialogue versus action.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Basic-standard-screenplay-formats"><a href="#Part-2-Basic-standard-screenplay-formats" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Basic standard screenplay formats"></a>Part 2. Basic standard screenplay formats</h2><p>Screenplay format is <strong>a collection of 12 different elements</strong>, and writers should keep in mind that formatting their screenplay will benefit them in the long run.</p><p>The first tip is to begin with Fade In, which is located at the top left of the page. This informs your reader of their location and serves as a template for what should be written in your script.</p><p>If you want to be a screenwriter, you must be familiar with the proper screenplay format. It is not sufficient to simply write the dialogue and action for your script.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-2.jpg"                      alt="basic standard screenplay formats"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896546/19272" target="_top" id="1896546">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896546" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896546/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>You must also include all the other elements so that no one is confused about what each one means. Many factors must be considered when writing good screenplays, such as formatting to make the screenplay readable to others. The script should be formatted in accordance with industry standards, with adequate margins, spaces between dialogues and action lines, and so on, so that readers can easily follow it.</p><p>Screenplays are a type of written or visual storytelling in which <strong>dialogue, action, and description are all included</strong>. They are typically used in the film industry to pitch a film or television show idea. They can be either fiction or nonfiction, depending on whether they use fictional stories or real-life facts.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Templates-for-screenplay"><a href="#Part-3-Templates-for-screenplay" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Templates for screenplay"></a>Part 3. Templates for screenplay</h2><p>In simple words, a screenplay format template is a ready-made structure into which characters, movements, and story elements can be inserted to create a usable screenplay. It is essentially a layout with specific characteristics that suit a particular genre of screenwriting.</p><p>A psychological thriller script, for example, will have a different structure and pace than an action script. Both genres have storyboard templates that can be used for a variety of stories from each genre.</p><p>A thriller script template will structure character movement, staging, and dialogue delivery to look and move like an ideal thriller while preventing it from looking and moving like an action element.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-3.jpg"                      alt="templates for screenplay"                ></p><p>We currently have screenplay format templates for nearly every theatrical and film genre, including drama, comedy, action, thriller, autobiography, and others. Each of these templates has a unique structure, but the best ones share some characteristics.</p><h3 id="1-Characteristics-of-the-Ideal-Screenplay-Format-Template"><a href="#1-Characteristics-of-the-Ideal-Screenplay-Format-Template" class="headerlink" title="1. Characteristics of the Ideal Screenplay Format Template"></a>1. Characteristics of the Ideal Screenplay Format Template</h3><p>Regardless of the screenplay genre, each screenplay template has some characteristics that set it apart from the rest. However, all ideal scenarios have the following characteristics in common:</p><ul><li>Complex layout</li><li>Current features</li><li>Configurability</li><li>Creative space</li></ul><p>Let’s look at each of the characteristics individually.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068432/7443" target="_top" id="2068432">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068432" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068432/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Comprehensive-Layout"><a href="#2-Comprehensive-Layout" class="headerlink" title="2. Comprehensive Layout"></a>2. Comprehensive Layout</h3><p>If you look at the screenplays for some of the greatest movies ever made, you’ll find that they all contain a complete and detailed story arc with textbook variations in pacing and dialogue as the story progresses.</p><p>Yes, almost all screenplays have some holes that may have been overlooked in the writing, but as a structure, they will include all the essential aspects of the story they are telling.</p><p>That said, a great screenplay format template:</p><ul><li>Format by genre</li><li>Have enough space for brainstorming and subject research</li><li>Layout of main acts, chapters, and scenes</li><li>Leave room for editing characters and settings (left margin and right margin variations)</li><li>Easy to use for beginners</li></ul><p>Aside from some niche genres like anthology and neo-bizarro, every ideal screenplay format template has some combination of these qualities.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1610918/18409" target="_top" id="1610918">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1610918" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://coinrule.sjv.io/i/5597632/1610918/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Contemporary-Features"><a href="#3-Contemporary-Features" class="headerlink" title="3. Contemporary Features"></a>3. Contemporary Features</h3><p>Scenarios have had a similar structure since the beginning of the last century.</p><p>The same title page, with the same standard Courier font, text indentation, scene title&#x2F;slug line and subtitle prefixes (INT-EXT), action line layout, etc. All this has remained unchanged over the years.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-4.jpg"                      alt="contemporary features"                ></p><p>However, with the advent of app-based screenwriting software, we have plenty of contemporary features such as automatic page numbers, time of day, parentheses, and pop-ups with specific character names.</p><p>Even the general rule of thumb “one-page equals one minute of screen time” doesn’t apply to all scripts today.</p><p>While it’s not necessary to have a fully automated script layout interface, any task that can be automated gives the writer more time for important tasks like contributing to off-screen production, recording voice-overs, etc.</p><p>Plus, since most writers today prefer a smartphone to a traditional typewriter, it pays to have a screenplay editor in the palm of your hand.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528703/16446" target="_top" id="1528703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528703/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Configurability"><a href="#4-Configurability" class="headerlink" title="4. Configurability"></a>4. Configurability</h3><p>Rigid script formatting risks making your story look and sound like all the stories that have used it in the past.</p><p>The same events, the same character archetypes, the same moves and submissions, and the same build-ups can quickly become boring.</p><p>The best storyboard templates have a structure that is created with the genre of the story in mind but gives the writer room to play around with their characters, setting, etc.</p><p>For example, when I’m writing a character who’s learning to write a book, I’d like to show her picking up references from nature and various other creative genres and coming back to change her style—not just research from the works of other writers.</p><p>Taking an unconventional approach to character development can seem counterproductive and time-consuming. However, a good script draft will allow the writer to do this without making the script unbalanced.</p><h3 id="5-Creative-Space"><a href="#5-Creative-Space" class="headerlink" title="5. Creative Space"></a>5. Creative Space</h3><p>Stiffness is a very common factor in most traditional screenplay formats.</p><p>A certain rigidity is good because it keeps the story structured and prevents writers from focusing too deeply on one aspect and neglecting the rest.</p><p>However, script templates should not be too restrictive in terms of creative freedom for the writer.</p><p>For example, an ideal screenwriting template should allow one character out of several to experience a different phase of character development than the others at any point in the plot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-5.jpg"                      alt="creative space"                ></p><p>This prevents all characters from looking and sounding like they were cast from a similar mold and have no unique development of their own.</p><p>In addition, the best templates should allow screenwriters to adjust their plot development to write for feature films as well as series.</p><p>Common fictional tropes have already been adopted by thousands of screenwriters around the world. The job of a perfect template is to give you enough creative space to create a unique story from a traditional genre.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087234/19272" target="_top" id="2087234">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087234" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087234/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Make-your-own-screenplay-by-using-Filmora"><a href="#Part-4-Make-your-own-screenplay-by-using-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

In fact, according to a recent study, 92% of consumers say they heavily rely on online reviews and testimonials when making purchasing decisions. 88% of those consumers say they trust those testimonials as much as personal recommendations from their friends, family members, and colleagues. This means that if you can get your clients or customers talking about how great your products or services are on camera, it will help them make buying decisions, reinforce your brand message and build relationships with their followers and peers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/video-testimonial.jpg"                      alt="video testimonial"                ></p><h2 id="Why-Video-Testimonials-Are-Important-for-Marketing"><a href="#Why-Video-Testimonials-Are-Important-for-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Why Video Testimonials Are Important for Marketing"></a>Why Video Testimonials Are Important for Marketing</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144281/7443" target="_top" id="2144281">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144281" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144281/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Video-testimonials-help-customers-make-their-buying-decisions"><a href="#Video-testimonials-help-customers-make-their-buying-decisions" class="headerlink" title="Video testimonials help customers make their buying decisions"></a>Video testimonials help customers make their buying decisions</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/help-customers-decisions.jpg"                      alt="help customers decisions"                ></p><p>Video testimonials are an amazing way to demonstrate the value of your business. They help customers make their buying decisions, they’re more effective than written testimonials, and they are more authentic and believable than the written ones.</p><p>Video testimonials help reinforce your company’s message. When you see a product or service demonstrated in action by someone who is actually using it in real life—which is what happens when you watch a video—you can get a much better understanding of what it does for people who experience it firsthand. This can make an enormous difference when trying to convey the benefits of something like an electric toothbrush or headphones compared to just reading about them on paper or hearing about them from someone else who may not be fully knowledgeable about how awesome these products really are!</p><p>It also helps build relationships with potential clients because videos allow us to connect with people on a personal level in ways that would otherwise be impossible through text-only formats such as email messages only ever so briefly exchanged between two parties before being quickly forgotten forever when we move onto other things.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134234/18498" target="_top" id="2134234">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134234" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134234/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Video-testimonials-help-reinforce-your-company’s-message"><a href="#Video-testimonials-help-reinforce-your-company’s-message" class="headerlink" title="Video testimonials help reinforce your company’s message"></a>Video testimonials help reinforce your company’s message</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/reinforce-company-message.jpg"                      alt="reinforce company message"                ></p><p>Video testimonials are a great way to reinforce your company’s message and make potential customers feel like they know you, your business, and your products.</p><p>When customers see another person saying good things about their service, it makes them more likely to trust and use that service themselves. Video testimonials can help you reach a larger audience by being shared on social media, review sites, and other marketing channels.</p><p>If you want to build trust with your audience, having real people talk about their experiences in using your products is a great way to do it. Video testimonials can help you get more customers by showing them that other people have had good experiences with your product and that it does what it says it does. They can also help you sell more because when someone sees someone else saying how much they love a product, they will think “hey, maybe I should try this too.”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087248/19272" target="_top" id="2087248">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087248" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087248/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Video-testimonials-are-more-authentic-and-believable-than-written-ones"><a href="#Video-testimonials-are-more-authentic-and-believable-than-written-ones" class="headerlink" title="Video testimonials are more authentic and believable than written ones"></a>Video testimonials are more authentic and believable than written ones</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/authentic-video-testimonial.jpg"                      alt="authentic video testimonial"                ></p><p>Of course, written testimonials are still a great way to get your message across. However, video testimonials have some distinct advantages that make them more effective.</p><p>Consider this: Your prospective customer is going to be much more likely to click on the “read more” link in a written testimonial than they would be if you presented the same information in video form. That’s because videos are more memorable and emotional than text; they’re also more authentic and believable.</p><h3 id="Video-testimonials-help-build-relationships"><a href="#Video-testimonials-help-build-relationships" class="headerlink" title="Video testimonials help build relationships"></a>Video testimonials help build relationships</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/video-testimonial-build-relationships.jpg"                      alt="video testimonial build relationships"                ></p><p>As you know, there are lots of ways to market your business. But video testimonials are the most effective way to build relationships with your clients and prospects. Why? Because they’re personal, they allow you to showcase the client’s experience with your company, and they’re easy for people to share on social media!</p><p>If you haven’t done so already, we highly recommend that you start gathering video testimonials from all of your happy customers. This is a great way for them to tell their friends about their experience with your company, as well as an opportunity for them to see how other people like them were helped by working with you in the past.</p><h3 id="Making-a-video-with-your-clients-is-great-for-marketing"><a href="#Making-a-video-with-your-clients-is-great-for-marketing" class="headerlink" title="Making a video with your clients is great for marketing"></a>Making a video with your clients is great for marketing</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/make-video-with-clients.jpg"                      alt="make video with clients"                ></p><p>Making a video with your clients is great for marketing.</p><p>Video testimonials are one of the most effective ways to grow your business, and here’s why:</p><ul><li>They help convert more customers by showing off your different services</li><li>They build trust with potential new customers through personal stories about how you helped them or their family&#x2F;friends (which can be shared on social media platforms)</li></ul><p>They’re easy to share via email, text message, and social media sites like Facebook or Twitter</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151890/7443" target="_top" id="2151890">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151890" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151890/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We hope that this information has helped you understand the importance of video testimonials and why they can be such a beneficial marketing tool.

This is because the default preview window of most editors can be too small to show all the flaws in your clips. For example, you may have missed a spot during the color correction, which you would have missed when using normal view. However, accessing the function varies with the software and your device’s operating system. Here is how to access premiere pro full screen preview from different devices.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part1-How-to-Do-Full-Screen-Preview-with-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part1-How-to-Do-Full-Screen-Preview-with-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part1: How to Do Full Screen Preview with Premiere Pro?"></a>Part1: How to Do Full Screen Preview with Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Adobe Premiere Pro is one of a videographer’s best video editing software. This is because it offers you one of the largest libraries of creative and editing assets. Furthermore, you can work cross-platform through the Creative Clouds service.</p><p>Unfortunately, this becomes challenging for Windows and macOS users because of the operation difference between their devices. For example, the key names differ on each device’s keyboard. Windows Keyboards feature the CTRL key, and Apple offers the COMMAND key instead. As such, it is challenging to locate functions with HOTKEYS.</p><p>Below is a full guide on how to access Premiere full screen preview on both devices.</p><h3 id="Windows-Users"><a href="#Windows-Users" class="headerlink" title="Windows Users"></a><strong>Windows Users</strong></h3><ol><li>Launch Adobe Premiere Pro from your device and open your project file.</li><li>Once all the clips load on their tracks, you begin editing with the suite of creative assets from the program library. Some of the edits you can do include applying color LUTS and green screen.</li><li>Then, tap the <strong>Play</strong> button or the <strong>SPACEBAR</strong> key on your keyboard to preview your work.</li><li>To enable a large screen preview, press the Grave Key (represent by <strong>~</strong> on a Windows keyboard.

These varying border lines on your Monitor Panel help you determine which objects are out of frame. Unfortunately, the feature is unavailable on previews or export files. Regardless, it is an extremely useful feature for your post-production. Follow these steps to enable it in your projects.</p><ul><li>Launch Premiere Pro on your device and import your clip to the Monitor Panel.</li><li>Select the clip you want to edit and right-click on the screen.</li><li>Enable the Safe Margins option by checking the box beside its name.</li></ul><h2 id="Part2-What-If-Full-Screen-Preview-lags-heavily"><a href="#Part2-What-If-Full-Screen-Preview-lags-heavily" class="headerlink" title="Part2: What If Full Screen Preview lags heavily?"></a>Part2: What If Full Screen Preview lags heavily?</h2><p>So, you now know how to access Adobe Premiere Pro Full Screen Preview, but there is a problem. Your videos are not playing right, and you are wondering what to do. Here are a few solutions when you notice full screen preview is lagging</p><h3 id="1-Fix-your-video-rendering-and-playback-setting"><a href="#1-Fix-your-video-rendering-and-playback-setting" class="headerlink" title="1. Fix your video rendering and playback setting"></a>1. Fix your video rendering and playback setting</h3><p>Adobe Premiere Pro is configured to utilize your device’s GPU for rendering. However, using the wrong video rendering and playback settings can cause your full screen preview to lag. Follow these steps to fix the problem.</p><ul><li>Tap on <strong>Project settings</strong> to open the settings menu.</li><li>Then, proceed to <strong>Renderer</strong> to view your current settings. You will find the option under video rendering and playback.</li><li>Choose your device’s GPU as the default option to activate GPU acceleration. In addition, you will need a compatible graphics processing unit to support this function.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Uncheck-the-Mercury-Transmit-Feature"><a href="#2-Uncheck-the-Mercury-Transmit-Feature" class="headerlink" title="2. Uncheck the Mercury Transmit Feature"></a>2. Uncheck the Mercury Transmit Feature</h3><p>Another reason for full screen preview lag is Mercury Transmit. The feature allows you to transmit your video to a secondary screen. However, it takes up valuable RAM, especially when you do not own a second monitor. Here is how to disable it.</p><ul><li>Open your program settings and proceed to the <strong>Playback</strong></li><li>Uncheck the <strong>Enable Mercury Transmit</strong> option in the resulting menu.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141676/17091" target="_top" id="2141676">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2141676" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141676/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Always-update-your-system-hardware-and-software"><a href="#3-Always-update-your-system-hardware-and-software" class="headerlink" title="3. Always update your system hardware and software"></a>3. Always update your system hardware and software</h3><p>Sometimes your full screen previews may lag because you miss the latest updates. Typically, developers provide users with free regular updates to make their software run better. For example, Adobe Premiere Pro issues regular updates to fix bugs and provide you with more creative library content.</p><p>As such, ensure you have the <strong>Check For Updates</strong> function enabled in your programs. Kindly note the feature only works if your device has an active internet connection.</p><h3 id="4-Play-the-video-at-a-lower-playback-resolution"><a href="#4-Play-the-video-at-a-lower-playback-resolution" class="headerlink" title="4. Play the video at a lower playback resolution"></a>4. Play the video at a lower playback resolution</h3><p>It is not wrong wanting to preview your video at 4K resolution. However, this can cause the program to lag significantly, especially if your device has low specs. In addition, changing your preview’s playback resolution does not affect its export settings. Follow these steps to make the changes:</p><ul><li>Access the <strong>Playback Resolution</strong> menu of your video clip from the <strong>Settings</strong></li><li>Then, alternate between lower values until the video lag stops. Currently, you can lower your Premiere full screen preview playback resolution up to 1&#x2F;16 the original value.</li></ul><h2 id="Part3-What’s-the-Best-Alternative-to-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part3-What’s-the-Best-Alternative-to-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part3: What’s the Best Alternative to Premiere Pro?"></a>Part3: What’s the Best Alternative to Premiere Pro?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/premiere-full-screen-preview-6.jpg"                      alt="best alternative to premiere pro"                ></p><p>So, you have given up on Premiere Pro’s persistent problems.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Complete-Azure-Guide-to-Speech-to-Text-Integration"><a href="#The-Complete-Azure-Guide-to-Speech-to-Text-Integration" class="headerlink" title="The Complete Azure Guide to Speech-to-Text Integration"></a>The Complete Azure Guide to Speech-to-Text Integration</h2><p>Are you tired of manually typing texts into document editors like Word and Notepad? Use <strong>Microsoft speech to text</strong> service. This service was launched in 2020 alongside the text-to-speech service, which includes famous computer-generated voices like <strong>Microsoft Sam</strong> and his brother, Mike. So, in this short read, you’ll learn what <strong>Microsoft Azure speech to text</strong> service is and its capabilities. I’ll also introduce you to the best Microsoft Azure STT alternatives. Let’s hunker down!</p><p><strong>Top Alternative to Microsoft Azure STT</strong> Save plenty of time on transcribing subtitles and boost your editing efficiency by applying Filmora Speech-To-Text.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try STT Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try STT Now <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Explore STT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Microsoft-Azure-and-Speech-Studio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Microsoft-Azure-and-Speech-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Microsoft Azure and Speech Studio?"></a>Part 1: What is Microsoft Azure and Speech Studio?</h2><p>Microsoft Azure STT and TTS are part of <strong>Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech</strong>. These cognitive services feature state-of-the-art intelligence covering voice recognition, speaker recognition, machine translation, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition). The Microsoft speech to text service uses Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) to auto-recognize, analyze, and convert human voices to editable and searchable texts.</p><p>Having said that, Azure STT lets you transcribe streaming audio, microphone commentary, or local audio files. It supports 100+ languages, including English, German, French, Swahili, Hindi, Ukrainian, Turkish, Arabic, and more. Remember that this service also supports batch transcription, allowing you to transcribe multiple audios in batch.</p><p>In the meantime, Azure STT is available in many formats, including Speech SDK. Speech SDK (Software Development Kit) allows you to use popular programming languages to create a speech-enabled application. It’s compatible with Java, JavaScript, Python, Visual Studio C++, Swift, and Objective-C.</p><p>If you’re not good with programming languages, use Speech CLI, a command tool that allows you to use the speech recognition service without entering a code. Put simply, it features a minimal setup with precise requirements. Plus, it features pretty much everything you’ll find in Speech SDK. So, it depends on your skills and preference.</p><p>It is also worth noting that Azure Speech Studio supports keyword recognition or keyword spotting. You can generate keyword recognition models and specify any short phrase or word. Users can also personalize keywords with the correct punctuations. And best of all, there is no extra cost for customizing keywords.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151888/7443" target="_top" id="2151888">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151888" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151888/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Transcribe-Speech-to-Text-with-Microsoft-Speech-Studio"><a href="#Part-2-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Transcribe-Speech-to-Text-with-Microsoft-Speech-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Step by Step Guide to Transcribe Speech to Text with Microsoft Speech Studio"></a>Part 2: Step by Step Guide to Transcribe Speech to Text with Microsoft Speech Studio</h2><p>Now let’s learn how to use Microsoft Azure speech recognition services. Remember, the conversion may not be accurate if the audio has lots of domain-industry jargon or ambient noises. Therefore, use crisp-clear audio with an external mic or train the software to recognize specific words or keywords. Let’s get started!</p><p>Step1Start by creating a Microsoft Azure account. You’ll start with the free version, which gives you a <strong>$200 credit to use within 30 days</strong>. After depleting the free credits, use the pay-as-you-go model, which unlocks 40+ Azure services.</p><p>Step2After creating a Microsoft Azure portal, you’ll see all Azure services. Click the Speech Services tab or search for “speech services” on the search bar. Now click Create and then fill out the project details. Then, click Review and Create before clicking Create.</p><p>Step3The program will take a while to deploy an instance. Now tap Keys and endpoints on the left pane and copy the key and region identifier as you may need them later on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/microsoft-speech-to-text-1.jpg"                      alt="micrsoft azure speech to text copy key and region"                ></p><p>Step4Download and install Microsoft Visual C++ and .NET Core 3.1 Runtime. Next, install Speech CL on .NET by running this command “**dotnet tool install -global Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech.CLI.**” Alternatively, download and install Speech CLI for Windows PCs as a <a class="link"   href="https://aka.ms/speech/spx-windows" >ZIP file <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step5Now enter the Azure regional identifier and subscription key on Windows Terminal or PowerShell. To configure the region and key, run these commands; “<strong>spx config @key –set SUBSCRIPTION-KEY</strong> and **spx config @region –set REGION.**”</p><p>Step6Now it’s time to convert speech to text using Azure STT Service. To do that, run “<strong>spx recognize -microphone</strong>” on Terminal or PowerShell. Azure Speech CLI will listen to sound input and convert it to text.

Other STT platforms&#x2F;stages require you to use the application to convert speech-to-text, save, and export into other third-party software. However, Wondershare Filmora allows you to directly convert your speech-to-text on an ongoing production.

Most of you may not be aware that Google Docs can accurately convert speech to text. This makes it a handy tool if you find speaking easier than writing. As expected, this voice transcription tool recognizes hundreds of languages, like English, French, Italian, Hindi, etc.</p><p>But although it does a commendable job, less-than-clear audio won’t give you accurate transcriptions. Also, it doesn’t feature niceties like periods, commas, and other punctuations. As such, stick to a professional app like Filmora to transcribe your audio to text.</p><p>Steps to convert voice to text with Google Docs:</p><p>Step1Open a new document on Google Docs and then click Voice typing. The inbuilt microphone will automatically launch.</p><p>Step2Next, click the language drop-down arrow on the microphone to choose the transcription language. You can dictate texts in English, Espanol, French, Italian, Afrikaans, Arabic, and more.</p><p>Step3Click the Microphone icon to start dictating texts on Google Docs.

You can select the automatic transcription that uses AI or professional real-human transcription. So, let’s choose Automatic.</p><p>Step2Drag-n-drop your video or audio file on the program and then choose the transcription language. After adding your file, click Upload to scan and transcribe it. This should take a while.</p><p>Step3Finally, click the transcribed text file to edit it with new texts and punctuations on the inbuilt editor. You can export your transcription in .txt, .srt, or .docx formats.

But it was only until the emergence of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) technologies that this invention burst into life. Today, most smartphones and computers come baked with <strong>automatic speech recognition</strong> services. So, what exactly is voice recognition, and how can you exploit it on your smartphone or desktop? This article answers these questions. You’ll also learn how to use the best free voice recognition programs. Let’s dig in!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Speech-Recognition"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Speech-Recognition" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Speech Recognition?"></a>Part 1: What is Speech Recognition?</h2><p>Computers and smartphones are catching up with human intelligence. Today, you can command your computer, smartphone, or smart speaker. Google Assistant, Microsoft’s Cortana, and Amazon Alexa are good examples of how far speech recognition has come. Just give a command, and the voice assistant will be at your service.</p><p>But this article will dive a little deeper than the obvious. Instead of dwelling on voice assistants, we’ll discuss how you can use an automated STT program to convert audio to text. The speech recognition technology has matured enough to allow users to enjoy 99% transcription accuracy. Also, these speech-to-text transcription programs support hundreds of languages, making them perfect for bloggers, teachers, doctors, and other professions.</p><p>But take note that the ability and complexity of these programs may vary. While some are beginner-friendly, others, like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, can be a little intimidating to beginners. Also, some TTS programs like Google Speech Recognition don’t need PC downloads, saving you time. So, it depends on your preferences and skills.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144285/7443" target="_top" id="2144285">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144285" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144285/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Free-Speech-Recognition-Services-in-2022"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Free-Speech-Recognition-Services-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Free Speech Recognition Services in 2022"></a>Part 2: Best Free Speech Recognition Services in 2022</h2><p>We understand that professional speech-to-text services can cost a few hundreds of dollars.

The company features multiple transcription services, including <a class="link"   href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=ar&tl=en&op=translate&hl=en" >Google Translate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which translates audio, documents, and texts between various languages. It supports 133 languages and is free to use on your mobile or PC browser. Just click the microphone icon on Google Translate and begin translating words.</p><p>Besides translation, use <a class="link"   href="https://cloud.google.com/" >Google Cloud <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to transcribe video, audio, or voice to increase your audience reach. Users can add accurate captions and subtitles to their content in real-time, thanks to ML technology similar to what Google uses to generate YouTube subtitles. It’s tailored for the Global user base as it supports 125+ languages. Google Cloud also allows you to boost transcription accuracy by providing domain-specific words or keywords.</p><p>As for the pricing, Google Cloud gives you up to $300 credits to spend over three months with the free tier. After exhausting the free minutes, you can transcribe 15-second audio for just $0.006. Now that should be affordable for all average Joes out there.</p><p>If Google Cloud doesn’t impress you, transcribe audio for free with <a class="link"   href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/" >Google Docs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s an online service allowing you to dictate texts from the built-in microphone. To do that, start a new document, click “Tools,” and then tap “Voice typing.” Now dictate unlimited texts before editing them accordingly.

First, you can use the built-in speech recognition service on your Windows 10&#x2F;11 computer. It’s a free service that gives you essential assistant and command capabilities. Please note that this is different from Cortana’s voice assistant.</p><p>To use Windows speech-to-text service, start by opening the program into which you want to dictate texts. This can be your browser, text editor, and so on. Then, click the Win + H shortcut before clicking the microphone icon to start dictating texts.</p><p>Alternatively, use the super-accurate <a class="link"   href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-to-text/" >Microsoft Azure <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> speech-to-text service. This professional feature lets you create texts from a host of audio sources. It provides real-time audio transcription, thanks to the deep ML and AI networks that work in sync to support multiple audio sources concurrently. However, setting it up is a different ballgame altogether.</p><p>If Azure Speech to Text is too complicated for you, use OneNote to dictate texts while signed into Microsoft 365. This voice recognition software can dictate texts with punctuations, emojis, periods, symbols, currencies, and more. Also, you can edit texts by merely uttering words like delete, undo, backspace, etc.</p><ol><li><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Wondershare Filmora 11</strong></a></li></ol><p>Wondershare Filmora 11 is a powerful video editor for macOS and Windows systems. It packs many powerful features, including the AI-driven speech-to-text and text-to-speech converters. Here, you can transcribe audio or video in various languages before editing and extracting the text to a .srt file. So yes, it’s a fast and accurate subtitle generator for desktops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-3.jpg"                      alt="filmora speech recognition create project"                ></p><p>To generate subtitles with Filmora 11, run the program on your desktop and create a New Project. After that, click the Import button to browse and load a video or audio from your local storage. Of course, you can drag and drop the media file to save time. Either way, move the uploaded file to the storyboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-4.jpg"                      alt="filmora speech recognition set language"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115916/19272" target="_top" id="2115916">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115916" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115916/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Next up, right-click the video and choose Detach Audio. In other words, you’ll be separating audio from the video clip. After that, select the audio track on the timeline and click the Speech-to-Text icon to choose the transcription language. You can transcribe the audio in English, French, German, Italian, and other languages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-5.jpg"                      alt="filmora speech recognition edit texts"                ></p><p>Now tap “Ok” to encode audio to subtitle texts. If the process is successful, double-tap the text track on the timeline to view and edit the subtitle tracks. You can change the text, layout, size, color, and more. Lastly, export the texts to an SRT file and use it on any video. It’s that quick and easy!</p><ol><li><strong>Amazon Transcribe</strong></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-6.jpg"                      alt="amazon speech recognition"                ></p><p>Have you ever heard of AWS? Well, it is a comprehensive cloud platform with more than 200 services. AWS uses Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, making it easier, faster, and more cost-friendly. Even better, AWS has up to 98 security standard certifications, making it one of the safest cloud platforms to create and edit content.</p><p>That said, use the <a class="link"   href="https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/" >Amazon Transcribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature to convert audio and voices into editable texts automatically. This service lets you extract critical insights from voice calls, videos, conversations, microphone narrations; you name them. It also uses deep ML to add formatting and punctuations to your text during dictation.</p><p>AWS Transcribe also includes a few extras that you might find helpful. For example, it supports batch processing from numerous audio sources. Also, it can identify different speakers and vocabulary filtering, giving you the much-needed consistency. Plus, you can add specific vocabulary and keywords to enhance content accuracy.</p><p>Cost-wise, you’ll enjoy up to 60 minutes of free transcription services with an AWS free tier account. After depleting the credits, you can pay for the standard pay-as-you-go rates. All in all, it’s an excellent speech recognition service, although it can be an overkill for personal use.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Speech-Recognition-FAQs"><a href="#Part-3-Speech-Recognition-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Speech Recognition FAQs"></a>Part 3: Speech Recognition FAQs</h2><p>Do you have a lot of unanswered questions about voice recognition? Here are some answers to the most common speech recognition FAQs.</p><h3 id="1-Is-dictating-texts-faster-than-typing-texts"><a href="#1-Is-dictating-texts-faster-than-typing-texts" class="headerlink" title="1. Is dictating texts faster than typing texts?"></a>1. Is dictating texts faster than typing texts?</h3><p>It depends! For people without quick typing skills, dictating audio is a no-brainer. TTS programs such as Windows Speech Recognition and Google Docs allow you to dictate texts directly into the document file before editing where necessary. However, it takes a lot of discipline and clarity to dictate texts accurately.</p><h3 id="2-How-can-I-improve-the-accuracy-of-speech-recognition"><a href="#2-How-can-I-improve-the-accuracy-of-speech-recognition" class="headerlink" title="2. How can I improve the accuracy of speech recognition?"></a>2. How can I improve the accuracy of speech recognition?</h3><p>First of all, some speech recognition services are more accurate than others. But the overall text accuracy will depend on the clarity of your voice. While the built-in mic will do fine, investing in a noise-canceling voice input device is better. You should also dictate texts with longer phrases more often. And another thing, avoid using slang and abbreviations.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134236/18498" target="_top" id="2134236">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134236" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134236/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Is-voice-recognition-technology-accurate"><a href="#3-Is-voice-recognition-technology-accurate" class="headerlink" title="3.

What factors should you take into consideration? And what are some of the common mistakes made by podcasters when it comes to naming their shows? So let’s dive into it.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Avoid-using-any-names-trademarked-copyrighted-or-already-in-use-by-another-show"><a href="#Tip-1-Avoid-using-any-names-trademarked-copyrighted-or-already-in-use-by-another-show" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1. Avoid using any names trademarked, copyrighted, or already in use by another show"></a>Tip 1. Avoid using any names trademarked, copyrighted, or already in use by another show</h3><p>The main legal principles with podcasts are copyright, publicity rights, and trademark. Therefore, Avoiding using any trademarked, copyrighted, or already used by another company or podcast is crucial.</p><p>Searching Google for trademarks is the best way to discover whether your name idea has already been trademarked. Moreover, you can check for conflicts by applying for podcast name approval via the Apple Podcasts Connect portal. If you’re unsure what you want, research similar names before settling.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Make-sure-the-name-has-not-been-used-before-on-Apple-Podcasts-and-Spotify"><a href="#Tip-2-Make-sure-the-name-has-not-been-used-before-on-Apple-Podcasts-and-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2.

Make sure the name has not been used before on Apple Podcasts and Spotify</h3><p>It is easy to search for your show’s potential name in a podcast directory. However, if the same name is already used, it is time to create a variation or start over.</p><p>You cannot submit your podcast to Spotify if there is a show with the same title. Doing your research will save you time and hassle.</p><h3 id="Tip-3-iTunes-Apple-Podcasts-Keywords-“Spam-”"><a href="#Tip-3-iTunes-Apple-Podcasts-Keywords-“Spam-”" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3. iTunes &#x2F; Apple Podcasts &amp; Keywords “Spam.”"></a>Tip 3. iTunes &#x2F; Apple Podcasts &amp; Keywords “Spam.”</h3><p>Another goal in boosting or promoting your channel would be to make a channel name that is simple and easy to pronounce. Avoid overly long podcast names or “keyword stuffing,” as iTunes&#x2F;Apple Podcasts are clamping down on this.</p><p>When the audience comes and visits your channel, the name of it matters the most as it’s the most obvious thing that meets the eyes. In this case, you must create a channel name that is true to your content and catchy so it hooks the audience from the start.</p><h3 id="Tip-4-Try-to-say-your-podcast’s-name-out-loud-and-a-lot"><a href="#Tip-4-Try-to-say-your-podcast’s-name-out-loud-and-a-lot" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4. Try to say your podcast’s name out loud and a lot"></a>Tip 4. Try to say your podcast’s name out loud and a lot</h3><p>As a podcast is an audio medium, your name should be easy to pronounce. You should also be able to recognize your podcast name if you hear it in passing, and it should be easy to pronounce. You can practice saying your podcast name by completing the following sentences:</p><ul><li>“Hi, I’m the host of ___________.”</li><li>“Welcome to another episode of ___________.”</li><li>“You’ve got to listen to ___________!”</li></ul><p>Choose a name you like to say because you’ll be saying it.

Can 2 podcasts have the same name?"></a>1. Can 2 podcasts have the same name?</h3><p>The simple answer would be <strong>“No.”</strong> You cannot have a podcast whose name is similar to another. It becomes an issue of legality and ethicality. If you create a channel with a name similar to another podcast, the original podcast channel will have a right to sue your channel.</p><p>In some rare cases, there have been podcasts with similar names, but usually, one of them will eventually go down.

Unfortunately, it is common in the industry as people tend to prey on the weak ones. But you can protect your channel by creating a podcast name that is unique in itself.</p><p>If you find accounts that pretend to be your channel, you can ask your audience to report such sources. Or the best course is legal action. But first, develop a trademark policy to help you give immunity against these channels.</p><p>So if in the future it gets to mislead your audience, they will be held accountable for legal action.</p><h3 id="4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast"><a href="#4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast" class="headerlink" title="4.

But as your audience grows, changing the channel’s name will only disturb your audience. They might think the original content creator was changed or the purpose of the show has been changed.</p><p>Keeping to your originality and creativity will set your channel in the light.

It becomes an issue of legality and ethicality. If you create a channel with a name similar to another podcast, the original podcast channel will have a right to sue your channel.</p><p>In some rare cases, there have been podcasts with similar names, but usually, one of them will eventually go down.

Unfortunately, it is common in the industry as people tend to prey on the weak ones. But you can protect your channel by creating a podcast name that is unique in itself.</p><p>If you find accounts that pretend to be your channel, you can ask your audience to report such sources. Or the best course is legal action. But first, develop a trademark policy to help you give immunity against these channels.</p><p>So if in the future it gets to mislead your audience, they will be held accountable for legal action.</p><h3 id="4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast-1"><a href="#4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast-1" class="headerlink" title="4.
