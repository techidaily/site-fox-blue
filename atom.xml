Start with duplicating the existing layer and then hiding the second layer. Double click on the layer to open the menu and then use “Blend IF” sliders. This option works when you drag the sliders to black points, and it automatically hides the dark pixels of your photo.</p><p>Similarly, if you drag the “Blend IF” sliders towards white pints, it can hide the light pixels. To hide any specific color from the picture, you can click on “Channels” and then select the color you want to eradicate completely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-9.jpg"                      alt="select the channel color"                ></p><p>This method only hides color based on their luminance values; however, this loads the entire layer when loading the active pixels. Regardless, this can be changed into transparency. For this, you need to select the layer by right-clicking and selecting the option of “Convert to Smart Object.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-10.jpg"                      alt="convert to smart object"                ></p><p>It helps the user create transparency across the layer. After hiding the layer and coming back to another object-specific layer, you can create a certain change in effect through adjustment layers. For instance, you can create a “Hue and Saturation” adjustment layer. With the above settings, Photoshop applies this as a layer mask for you. Use the sliders across the set layer to change the color across the selected areas.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-photo-color-11.jpg"                      alt="select your new color"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xg3PHS_Ee80?si=fE_iGIqHjKvWFIN3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/umvX4ZdWbxk?si=tPXL0-Kzf9SQaY8z" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Tip-7-Use-Online-Photo-Editor-to-Change-Colors"><a href="#7-Tip-7-Use-Online-Photo-Editor-to-Change-Colors" class="headerlink" title="7.

Now let’s have a look at what we can get after the downloading.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/szUqw4TLvWs?si=srv1OeLOe579gLwj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Benefits-of-Saving-Video-Twitter-to-MP3"><a href="#The-Benefits-of-Saving-Video-Twitter-to-MP3" class="headerlink" title="The Benefits of Saving Video Twitter to MP3"></a>The Benefits of Saving Video Twitter to MP3</h2><p>Converting a Twitter video to MP3 has immense benefits like offline playback, less mobile data usage, high-quality audio, and more. So, without wasting time, let’s discuss some reasons to convert <strong>Twitter video to MP3</strong>.</p><p><strong>1. Watch the video offline for free</strong></p><p>Are you always on the move with limited time to watch Twitter videos? Well, downloading a Twitter video to audio allows you to have an on-the-go music listening experience. As you may already know, you’ll need an internet connection to play Twitter videos, a luxury you may not always have. So get a Twitter video converter and play the audio offline for free.</p><p><strong>2. Gather sound effects</strong></p><p>You’ll know the benefits of adding sound effects to videos if you’re constantly editing videos on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and other social apps. Sound effects make videos more engaging by stimulating emotions, energy, and attention. And you know that finding free and quality sound effects can be challenging. For this reason, use a Twitter converter to extract sound effects from video.</p><p><strong>3. Extract famous movie quotes</strong></p><p>Twitter is an excellent platform for sharing movies. Some of these movie characters are known for their unique style that can motivate and influence their fans. Of course, this also includes music lyrics. With a Twitter video converter, you can easily extract famous movie quotes and share them with friends online. Besides audio, you can convert the quotes to text using a speech-to-text converter.</p><p><strong>4. Create an audiobook</strong></p><p>Many stories and cartoons are shared on Twitter that children will definitely find interesting. So, if you’re a fan of audiobooks, convert these Twitter videos to MP3 and upload them online. For example, you can find a video where the narrator is reading a book or their own story. Take advantage of this!</p><p><strong>5. Extract music from videos</strong></p><p>Listening to music on your smartphone or media player is more convenient than playing videos. The thing is that you can extract music from Twitter videos and create an offline mix. You can also use this music as your smartphone ringtone or share the music mix on social media and go viral.</p><p><strong>6. Improved loading speed</strong></p><p>Videos are obviously bigger than audio. As such, loading Twitter into your media player or online platform will need more resources, making the process slow. Remember that most video bandwidths are two or three times larger than audio bandwidths. So, to reduce the bandwidth and increase the loading speed, convert the Twitter video to MP3 audio.</p><p>Now that you have all the reasons to convert Twitter to MP3, let’s discuss the best Twitter MP3 downloader apps for online use. We’ll also review the best professional-grade Twitter video converter for Mac&#x2F;Windows PCs.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>These are the best ways to download and convert Twitter to MP3.

Bonus Tips for YouTube Video Titles"></a>Part 2. Bonus Tips for YouTube Video Titles</h2><p><strong>Utilize Keywords:</strong> Make sure your video title includes important SEO ranking variables since keywords YouTube video results mainly depend on SEO. The SEO keywords you want to rank for should be included in the perfect video names. To find relevant, easily ranked keywords, use a keyword research tool. Additionally, it is best to use competitive but highly searched keywords. Since YouTube is owned by Google, the search engine’s ranking formulas are largely the same.</p><p><strong>Video Title Length:</strong> Less than 70 characters make up the best YouTube video titles. Unless you have enough room, avoid including extraneous information in the title, such as the episode number or channel name. Despite YouTube’s 100-character maximum for video names, most search engines, including Google, will truncate your title after 70 characters.</p><p><strong>Use Truncation:</strong> Therefore, after you’ve used up your first 50 characters that are the most crucial, focus on your second part’s SEO-friendly components. The second section of your title will still aid in discoverability even if it is abbreviated since Google is likely to utilize the whole thing for ranking. Use the aforementioned YouTube title generating tool if you are running out of ideas.</p><p><strong>Improve Your Click Thru Rate (CTR):</strong> If someone sees your video in the YouTube or Google search results, they may either click on it or they can opt to skip over it and click on another video. They will typically base their choice on the appeal of your video title, the beauty of your selected thumbnail, and the applicability of your video description. When someone clicks on your video, it tells Google and YouTube that it’s a video that people are interested in watching.</p><p><strong>To increase the impact of your title, use emotive language:</strong> It’s crucial to take into account the emotions that viewers could experience while producing content for YouTube. Think about using some important emotion terms in your title if you want it to elicit a feeling. This may increase the impact of your title and draw in readers who are seeking for a certain emotion. You may give viewers an experience that is more powerful and memorable by considering the emotions that your material can elicit in them.</p><p><strong>Include Numbers When Needed:</strong> The likelihood that someone will interact with material given in a numerical format is higher. Therefore, it’s crucial to incorporate numbers in your titles if you want people to click on them. It may be useful to include numbers in headlines when it makes sense to do so. This is based on a time-tested marketing principle that still holds true today.</p><p><strong>Add Relevant Words:</strong> Your video’s title should briefly describe its subject matter. When people click on videos that don’t live up to their expectations, they feel irate and irritated. They make a mental note to stop watching more of your films as they swiftly leave to find a more suitable video.

Bonus Tips for YouTube Video Titles"></a>Part 2. Bonus Tips for YouTube Video Titles</h2><p><strong>Utilize Keywords:</strong> Make sure your video title includes important SEO ranking variables since keywords YouTube video results mainly depend on SEO. The SEO keywords you want to rank for should be included in the perfect video names. To find relevant, easily ranked keywords, use a keyword research tool. Additionally, it is best to use competitive but highly searched keywords. Since YouTube is owned by Google, the search engine’s ranking formulas are largely the same.</p><p><strong>Video Title Length:</strong> Less than 70 characters make up the best YouTube video titles. Unless you have enough room, avoid including extraneous information in the title, such as the episode number or channel name. Despite YouTube’s 100-character maximum for video names, most search engines, including Google, will truncate your title after 70 characters.</p><p><strong>Use Truncation:</strong> Therefore, after you’ve used up your first 50 characters that are the most crucial, focus on your second part’s SEO-friendly components. The second section of your title will still aid in discoverability even if it is abbreviated since Google is likely to utilize the whole thing for ranking. Use the aforementioned YouTube title generating tool if you are running out of ideas.</p><p><strong>Improve Your Click Thru Rate (CTR):</strong> If someone sees your video in the YouTube or Google search results, they may either click on it or they can opt to skip over it and click on another video. They will typically base their choice on the appeal of your video title, the beauty of your selected thumbnail, and the applicability of your video description. When someone clicks on your video, it tells Google and YouTube that it’s a video that people are interested in watching.</p><p><strong>To increase the impact of your title, use emotive language:</strong> It’s crucial to take into account the emotions that viewers could experience while producing content for YouTube. Think about using some important emotion terms in your title if you want it to elicit a feeling. This may increase the impact of your title and draw in readers who are seeking for a certain emotion. You may give viewers an experience that is more powerful and memorable by considering the emotions that your material can elicit in them.</p><p><strong>Include Numbers When Needed:</strong> The likelihood that someone will interact with material given in a numerical format is higher. Therefore, it’s crucial to incorporate numbers in your titles if you want people to click on them. It may be useful to include numbers in headlines when it makes sense to do so. This is based on a time-tested marketing principle that still holds true today.</p><p><strong>Add Relevant Words:</strong> Your video’s title should briefly describe its subject matter. When people click on videos that don’t live up to their expectations, they feel irate and irritated. They make a mental note to stop watching more of your films as they swiftly leave to find a more suitable video. As soon as Google and YouTube become aware of this conduct, your videos start to fall in the ranks.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>It is crucial to invest work into producing attention-grabbing titles for your YouTube videos if you want to make sure they are competitive and visible to a wide audience.

But it was only until the emergence of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) technologies that this invention burst into life. Today, most smartphones and computers come baked with <strong>automatic speech recognition</strong> services. So, what exactly is voice recognition, and how can you exploit it on your smartphone or desktop? This article answers these questions. You’ll also learn how to use the best free voice recognition programs. Let’s dig in!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Speech-Recognition"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Speech-Recognition" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Speech Recognition?"></a>Part 1: What is Speech Recognition?</h2><p>Computers and smartphones are catching up with human intelligence.

Instead of dwelling on voice assistants, we’ll discuss how you can use an automated STT program to convert audio to text. The speech recognition technology has matured enough to allow users to enjoy 99% transcription accuracy. Also, these speech-to-text transcription programs support hundreds of languages, making them perfect for bloggers, teachers, doctors, and other professions.</p><p>But take note that the ability and complexity of these programs may vary. While some are beginner-friendly, others, like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, can be a little intimidating to beginners. Also, some TTS programs like Google Speech Recognition don’t need PC downloads, saving you time. So, it depends on your preferences and skills.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Free-Speech-Recognition-Services-in-2022"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Free-Speech-Recognition-Services-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Free Speech Recognition Services in 2022"></a>Part 2: Best Free Speech Recognition Services in 2022</h2><p>We understand that professional speech-to-text services can cost a few hundreds of dollars.

Now that should be affordable for all average Joes out there.</p><p>If Google Cloud doesn’t impress you, transcribe audio for free with <a class="link"   href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/" >Google Docs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s an online service allowing you to dictate texts from the built-in microphone. To do that, start a new document, click “Tools,” and then tap “Voice typing.” Now dictate unlimited texts before editing them accordingly. Remember, Google Docs supports collaborative editing.</p><ol><li><strong>Microsoft speech recognition</strong></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-2.jpg"                      alt="windows speech recognition"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l4R7_qNIQvY?si=2zJOPfEcm6_3udzn" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Like Google, Microsoft has a collection of speech recognition services too. First, you can use the built-in speech recognition service on your Windows 10&#x2F;11 computer. It’s a free service that gives you essential assistant and command capabilities. Please note that this is different from Cortana’s voice assistant.</p><p>To use Windows speech-to-text service, start by opening the program into which you want to dictate texts. This can be your browser, text editor, and so on. Then, click the Win + H shortcut before clicking the microphone icon to start dictating texts.</p><p>Alternatively, use the super-accurate <a class="link"   href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech-to-text/" >Microsoft Azure <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> speech-to-text service. This professional feature lets you create texts from a host of audio sources. It provides real-time audio transcription, thanks to the deep ML and AI networks that work in sync to support multiple audio sources concurrently. However, setting it up is a different ballgame altogether.</p><p>If Azure Speech to Text is too complicated for you, use OneNote to dictate texts while signed into Microsoft 365. This voice recognition software can dictate texts with punctuations, emojis, periods, symbols, currencies, and more. Also, you can edit texts by merely uttering words like delete, undo, backspace, etc.</p><ol><li><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Wondershare Filmora 11</strong></a></li></ol><p>Wondershare Filmora 11 is a powerful video editor for macOS and Windows systems. It packs many powerful features, including the AI-driven speech-to-text and text-to-speech converters. Here, you can transcribe audio or video in various languages before editing and extracting the text to a .srt file. So yes, it’s a fast and accurate subtitle generator for desktops.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-3.jpg"                      alt="filmora speech recognition create project"                ></p><p>To generate subtitles with Filmora 11, run the program on your desktop and create a New Project. After that, click the Import button to browse and load a video or audio from your local storage. Of course, you can drag and drop the media file to save time. Either way, move the uploaded file to the storyboard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-4.jpg"                      alt="filmora speech recognition set language"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3AGmFrtBLHw?si=VhvpUaXHPBHl6OT6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Next up, right-click the video and choose Detach Audio. In other words, you’ll be separating audio from the video clip. After that, select the audio track on the timeline and click the Speech-to-Text icon to choose the transcription language. You can transcribe the audio in English, French, German, Italian, and other languages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-5.jpg"                      alt="filmora speech recognition edit texts"                ></p><p>Now tap “Ok” to encode audio to subtitle texts. If the process is successful, double-tap the text track on the timeline to view and edit the subtitle tracks. You can change the text, layout, size, color, and more. Lastly, export the texts to an SRT file and use it on any video. It’s that quick and easy!</p><ol><li><strong>Amazon Transcribe</strong></li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/speech-recognition-software-6.jpg"                      alt="amazon speech recognition"                ></p><p>Have you ever heard of AWS? Well, it is a comprehensive cloud platform with more than 200 services. AWS uses Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, making it easier, faster, and more cost-friendly. Even better, AWS has up to 98 security standard certifications, making it one of the safest cloud platforms to create and edit content.</p><p>That said, use the <a class="link"   href="https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/" >Amazon Transcribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> feature to convert audio and voices into editable texts automatically. This service lets you extract critical insights from voice calls, videos, conversations, microphone narrations; you name them. It also uses deep ML to add formatting and punctuations to your text during dictation.</p><p>AWS Transcribe also includes a few extras that you might find helpful. For example, it supports batch processing from numerous audio sources. Also, it can identify different speakers and vocabulary filtering, giving you the much-needed consistency. Plus, you can add specific vocabulary and keywords to enhance content accuracy.</p><p>Cost-wise, you’ll enjoy up to 60 minutes of free transcription services with an AWS free tier account. After depleting the credits, you can pay for the standard pay-as-you-go rates. All in all, it’s an excellent speech recognition service, although it can be an overkill for personal use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UCqHbpxQGP4?si=XGkajFHdqyoKNAFM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Speech-Recognition-FAQs"><a href="#Part-3-Speech-Recognition-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Speech Recognition FAQs"></a>Part 3: Speech Recognition FAQs</h2><p>Do you have a lot of unanswered questions about voice recognition?

Is dictating texts faster than typing texts?"></a>1. Is dictating texts faster than typing texts?</h3><p>It depends! For people without quick typing skills, dictating audio is a no-brainer. TTS programs such as Windows Speech Recognition and Google Docs allow you to dictate texts directly into the document file before editing where necessary. However, it takes a lot of discipline and clarity to dictate texts accurately.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SgRVYjqB70s?si=My_2cDvJVdincQRu" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-How-can-I-improve-the-accuracy-of-speech-recognition"><a href="#2-How-can-I-improve-the-accuracy-of-speech-recognition" class="headerlink" title="2.

How can I improve the accuracy of speech recognition?</h3><p>First of all, some speech recognition services are more accurate than others. But the overall text accuracy will depend on the clarity of your voice. While the built-in mic will do fine, investing in a noise-canceling voice input device is better. You should also dictate texts with longer phrases more often. And another thing, avoid using slang and abbreviations.</p><h3 id="3-Is-voice-recognition-technology-accurate"><a href="#3-Is-voice-recognition-technology-accurate" class="headerlink" title="3. Is voice recognition technology accurate?"></a>3. Is voice recognition technology accurate?</h3><p>Yes, all the voice recognition services discussed above are very accurate. But as said before, this depends on a lot of factors. Also, it’s paramount to preview your transcription work and add the necessary corrections. Remember, human intelligence is always superior.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1KKovVi9epE?si=EF7KA7b4KsEpWA-M" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h3><p>Now you know how speech recognition can be helpful in your documentation work.

As you cannot operate these cameras without their supporting system so it becomes essential to check the accessory kit price at the time of purchase. Prefer to buy a camera that provides all basic accessories with the box.</li><li><strong>Resolution:</strong> The major problem of maximum cameras is their poor resolution and picture clarity especially when they are mounted on helmet or moving objects.

According to most users, the built-in image viewer is not top of the list. As you keep reading, you will discover why Windows 10 Photos is not a good choice. In addition, you will find recommendations for fast image viewer Windows 10 and why they outrank the proprietary software. Finally, remember that the list contains free and paid programs you can use for your creative work.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">PhotoDirector 365</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">XnView Classic</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">IrfanView Graphic Viewer</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">WidsMob Viewer Pro</a></li><li><a href="#part2-5">Image Glass</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Best Free Video Editor to Make Slideshow with Photos</a></li><li><a href="#part4">FAQs</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part1-Why-Windows-10-photos-is-not-a-good-choice"><a href="#Part1-Why-Windows-10-photos-is-not-a-good-choice" class="headerlink" title="Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?"></a>Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?</h2><p>There are plenty of reasons why relying on Windows 10 photos for your creative work is a bad idea. Although the reasons vary between users, here are the main ones.</p><h4 id="1-It-is-slow"><a href="#1-It-is-slow" class="headerlink" title="1. It is slow"></a><strong>1. It is slow</strong></h4><p>The Photos app is not a fast photo viewer for Windows 10. Regardless of your computer’s specs, it takes approximately similar load times across all machines. Here are some of the reasons for this flaw:</p><ul><li>Photos take between 10 and 20 seconds to load because the program needs to check if you are connected to your One Drive account.</li><li>Accessing the app through your <strong>File Explorer menu</strong> will alsotake you a while, especially if you have other app extensions on the list. For example, if you have Windows 10 Photo viewer and MS Publisher active on the menu, Photo Viewer for Windows 10 takes a backseat.</li></ul><h4 id="2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process"><a href="#2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process" class="headerlink" title="2. It is bad at batch process"></a><strong>2. It is bad at batch process</strong></h4><p>For the amateur photographers reading this, photo batch processing is when you edit multiple pictures simultaneously. For example, image viewer Windows 10 lets you download multiple images with a single click.</p><p>However, that is about as much you can get when using the program compared to the dozens of photo enhancements you can do with other similar software.??</p><h4 id="3-Program-crash-galore"><a href="#3-Program-crash-galore" class="headerlink" title="3. Program crash galore"></a><strong>3. Program crash galore</strong></h4><p>It is fine for computer software to crash occasionally. However, Windows 10 Photo Viewer takes it to the next level. The application crashes nearly every step of the photo viewing process. For example, it is common for your photo to freeze when saving your edits. As such, you have to restart the program and redo the adjustments.</p><h4 id="4-Horrible-user-experience"><a href="#4-Horrible-user-experience" class="headerlink" title="4. Horrible user experience"></a><strong>4. Horrible user experience</strong></h4><p>How quickly can you save a file to the cloud? Most programs take seconds. Unfortunately, using image viewer Windows 10 is a completely different ball game.?</p><p>First, you have to save a copy of your photo. Then, find the duplicate and then upload it to One Drive. What a nightmare!</p><h2 id="Part2-Top-Best-Fast-Photo-Viewer-for-Windows-10"><a href="#Part2-Top-Best-Fast-Photo-Viewer-for-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Top Best Fast Photo Viewer for Windows 10"></a>Part2: Top Best Fast Photo Viewer for Windows 10</h2><p>There are several more reasons why you should not use photo viewer for Windows 10.

How can you switch from photo viewer for Windows 10 to your preferred software?</h4><p>Access the <strong>Default Apps</strong> menu from the <strong>Settings</strong> option of your OS. Then, change your preferred app by selecting it from the <strong>Photos</strong> menu.</p><p>Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?</p><p>There are plenty of reasons why relying on Windows 10 photos for your creative work is a bad idea. Although the reasons vary between users, here are the main ones.</p><h4 id="1-It-is-slow-1"><a href="#1-It-is-slow-1" class="headerlink" title="1. It is slow"></a><strong>1. It is slow</strong></h4><p>The Photos app is not a fast photo viewer for Windows 10. Regardless of your computer’s specs, it takes approximately similar load times across all machines. Here are some of the reasons for this flaw:</p><ul><li>Photos take between 10 and 20 seconds to load because the program needs to check if you are connected to your One Drive account.</li><li>Accessing the app through your <strong>File Explorer menu</strong> will alsotake you a while, especially if you have other app extensions on the list. For example, if you have Windows 10 Photo viewer and MS Publisher active on the menu, Photo Viewer for Windows 10 takes a backseat.</li></ul><h4 id="2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process-1"><a href="#2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process-1" class="headerlink" title="2. It is bad at batch process"></a><strong>2. It is bad at batch process</strong></h4><p>For the amateur photographers reading this, photo batch processing is when you edit multiple pictures simultaneously. For example, image viewer Windows 10 lets you download multiple images with a single click.</p><p>However, that is about as much you can get when using the program compared to the dozens of photo enhancements you can do with other similar software.??</p><h4 id="3-Program-crash-galore-1"><a href="#3-Program-crash-galore-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Program crash galore"></a><strong>3. Program crash galore</strong></h4><p>It is fine for computer software to crash occasionally. However, Windows 10 Photo Viewer takes it to the next level. The application crashes nearly every step of the photo viewing process. For example, it is common for your photo to freeze when saving your edits. As such, you have to restart the program and redo the adjustments.</p><h4 id="4-Horrible-user-experience-1"><a href="#4-Horrible-user-experience-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Horrible user experience"></a><strong>4. Horrible user experience</strong></h4><p>How quickly can you save a file to the cloud? Most programs take seconds.

Putting background music to your video’s specially of the silent part of the video will give you and your video a unique vitality. But also remember to be very careful on using background music or sites where you take to use the music for your vlogs because not all the application software has passed YouTube’s partner programmed, your channel might be down or disapproved for monetization.</p><p>In this article we’re going to give you an idea on where you can get a free background music without worrying of copyrighted issue.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Why-Background-Music-is-Important"><a href="#Why-Background-Music-is-Important" class="headerlink" title="Why Background Music is Important"></a>Why Background Music is Important</h2><ul><li>Music is a huge part of what makes this content so engaging</li><li>Music takes your video to the next level</li><li>Background music is a smooth way to fill in moments that would otherwise be silent</li><li>Fill dead air when you have a visual but no sound.</li><li>Music sets the tone and inspire emotion</li><li>The music can help make a video feel long and sad or useful and informative</li><li>Help to boost the production value and cohesiveness of your video content</li><li>Help connect to your viewers with the content.</li><li>It add a little extra flavor and spice to your learning experience</li><li>Music is efficient to induce positive emotion and modulate mood</li></ul><h2 id="What-is-Royalty-Free-Music"><a href="#What-is-Royalty-Free-Music" class="headerlink" title="What is Royalty-Free Music?"></a>What is Royalty-Free Music?</h2><p><strong>Royalty-free music</strong></p><p>Is music that can be used without having to pay royalties.

Royalty-Free music simply helps users avoid the pitfalls that can result from trying to navigate complex licensing requirements.</p><h2 id="Places-to-find-Background-Music"><a href="#Places-to-find-Background-Music" class="headerlink" title="Places to find Background Music"></a>Places to find Background Music</h2><p><strong>YouTube Audio Library</strong></p><p>If you have a YouTube channel then its good to go, in YouTube Audio Library you can access more than 150,000 free tracks.

There are so many things to consider when it comes to what makes good background music. What’s the tone of your content, and who is the audience?</p><p>Consider if you are a Product reviewer or explainer use subtle music to maintain the attention of your viewer to the information and product demo. If you are action Vlogger or doing daily lifestyle Vlog, use clear music to explain and advance the plot.</p><p>Remember choose music that speaks to your audience, the more you know about your audience’s age, affiliations, and preferences, the more specific you can be about your music choice. If your viewers cover wide swath of professionals in business, it’s best to play it safe with corporate tones. Classic rock, and ambient music. But if you know that they’re younger hip hop and dance music might be more appropriate.</p><p>Editing Software the has Royalty-free stock music</p><p>Background music is the bridge that allows the video to transition smoothly between different ideas or scenes, especially when you have a jump cut</p><h2 id="Editing-software-with-Royalty-free-background-music"><a href="#Editing-software-with-Royalty-free-background-music" class="headerlink" title="Editing software with Royalty-free background music"></a>Editing software with Royalty-free background music</h2><p>Video editing is essential to all vloggers or content creator, you need to find a software that has license and won’t ruin your channel someday.
