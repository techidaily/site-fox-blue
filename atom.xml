One of the most talked about features includes <strong>iPhone X Face ID</strong> security option which helps in unlocking the device with just recognizing the user’s face. However, Android has also introduced this sort of security lock with <strong>Samsung’s face recognition</strong>. Both the companies are remarkable with their own enhancement and technologies and claims to be the best for this face recognition technology. We therefore have appeared here with a thorough analysis of both devices’ face recognition capability. Let’s master what’s the difference between both.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How does it work?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Which one is more Accuracy?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: The Common Inconvenience</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Safety Issue</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-How-does-it-work"><a href="#Part-1-How-does-it-work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How does it work?"></a>Part 1: How does it work?</h2><p> This section will cover how the face recognition technology works for both the devices. Check out the process.</p><p> iPhone X:</p><p> While talking about latest iPhone, the company has designed the face detection function with a range of advanced sensors which include dot projector, infrared camera flood illuminator etc. The first component holds the capability to scrutinize the user’s face using TrueDepth camera. The camera captures in-depth face via more than 30,000 invisible dots in order to get the accurate and distinctive 3D facial map. This way, any kind of movement of your face will not stop the device to detect it before unlocking. When the dot pattern completes, the Infrared camera takes an infrared photo of the face. Once this gets done, an A11 Bionic chip’s neural engine helps in transforming the detailing and infrared face for meticulous precisions and confirming the enrolled face by comparing all the corrections. The A11 chip comes with full protection and is protected with secure Enclave.</p><p> The flood illuminator aims at infrared flash for enabling the face recognition technology to detect the face no matter what the surrounding light is. Putting differently, your face can be recognized even in dim light since your face is been recorded through infrared light.</p><p> Samsung:</p><p> Samsung also uses almost identical operation and involves two components which are IR LED and Iris camera. The former can be said as similar to the flood illuminator of the newest iPhone. IR LED works same as flood illuminator. It however shows difference only by focusing the infrared light on the eyes unlike flood illuminator which focus on the entire face. The Iris camera is nothing but infrared camera whose job is to take the picture of your iris. The process begins with IR LED which assists Iris camera by illuminating the eyes so that the camera gets the opportunity to capture the iris pattern properly. Samsung has the option to choose between both iris scanning or just one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Samsung-Galaxy-S8-Face-Unlock.jpg"                      alt="Samsung"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Which-one-is-more-Accuracy"><a href="#Part-2-Which-one-is-more-Accuracy" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Which one is more Accuracy?"></a>Part 2: Which one is more Accuracy?</h2><p> Being accurate is a considerable issue with face recognition technology if you are using a Samsung device. On the other hand, iPhone X shows accuracy than Samsung since it analyzes the whole face instead of iris. For Samsung’s iris scanner, the camera contains a confined and narrowly designed focus where is exactly your iris needed to be for scanning. The camera will able to recognize only when your iris will be in that same place for long where it focuses. And therefore, there are times when you left with holding your device high for better iris detection. Apple has no such accuracy issue for it takes your face to recognize.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-x-accuracy.jpg"                      alt="iPhone X accuracy"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-The-Common-Inconvenience"><a href="#Part-3-The-Common-Inconvenience" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: The Common Inconvenience"></a>Part 3: The Common Inconvenience</h2><p> When it comes to practicality, we would state that both the phone don’t stand well for it. This is because if you use Apple’s latest invention i.e. iPhone X, you are required to first hold your device in your hand followed by looking at the screen. Then you need to swipe it up for unlocking the device.</p><p> On the other hand, when you are Samsung owner, you need to open your eyes accurately and stare the screen and the distance between the device and eyes ideally should be an arm length.</p><p> Both the devices need to be lifted to keep the face’s angle point accurately and it can look awkward when you need to use your device in a crowded place. Hence, both ways are kind of inconvenient to use especially when you wish to use your device secretly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/face-incovenience.jpg"                      alt="face ID incovenience"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Safety-Issue"><a href="#Part-4-Safety-Issue" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Safety Issue"></a>Part 4: Safety Issue</h2><p> Ensuring safety is one of the main concern people have and the face recognition technology in both the devices has done pretty well. Apple uses the TrueDepth camera system which includes flood illuminator, IR camera as well as dot projector to make the face recognized in all possible ways. It has been claimed by the company that the possibility of unlocking the device by a random person’s face is 1 in 1,000,000. Besides this, Apple had made sure to let people try only 5 face attempts after which they will require to enter the passcode. The probability though doesn’t work same for twins and the family members who resemble you. Also, the children who are less than 13 are able to trick you since they don’t have fully developed facial features.</p><p> Besides this, Apple has also made the newest model intelligent enough to not get fooled by any 2D photo or any other 2D mediums. Before releasing high-quality face recognition technology, Apple tested how the feature reacts with life-like masks and other techniques that can give rise to deceiving. To its surprise, the device got positive results and the Face ID has the ability to not get trapped by masks and the like things.</p><p> The Face ID by Apple in its iPhone X also makes itself proficient enough to detect the modifications in the appearances such as growing of beard or if a lady has applied makeup. Or if you have shaved your beard fully, the device takes a confirmation with the help of a passcode. What’s more, you don’t have to worry if you are wearing scarf or shades, cap, hat and even contact lenses, Face ID will work properly with the accessories too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/face-id-issue.jpg"                      alt="face ID issue"                ></p><p> On the other hand, Samsung also doesn’t lag behind when it comes to safety and security with face recognition feature. Samsung is the first Android device company to introduce face recognition technology that brought iris scanning technology with its Galaxy Note 7. The technology does it job by detecting the iris’ pattern of your eyes. As far as security is concerned, the technology gets 10 on 10 since each person possesses unique iris pattern and it becomes difficult to replicate. The devices by Samsung having face recognition technology are designed with infrared diode which is capable</p><p> All in all, both the companies have put extra effort in justifying the safety with trending face recognition technology. However, we are not certain for full reliability of them.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> The technology of facial recognition isn’t new to us and it has made people excited from the time it has come. However, many users have not started using the technology yet. We hope that this functionality will gain the popularity with time and people will start to make use of it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-inside-polarr-the-powerhouse-photo-toolkit-for-2024/"><u>[New] Inside Polarr  The Powerhouse Photo Toolkit for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/utilizing-zoom-services-directly-from-your-inbox-gmail-edition/"><u>Utilizing Zoom Services Directly From Your Inbox - Gmail Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-unlocking-the-art-of-photographic-posts-on-instagram-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unlocking the Art of Photographic Posts on Instagram for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/photo-refinement-essentials-expert-tips-for-efficient-background-clearance-for-2024/"><u>Photo Refinement Essentials  Expert Tips for Efficient Background Clearance for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/choosing-the-optimal-power-source-for-advanced-drones-for-2024/"><u>Choosing the Optimal Power Source for Advanced Drones for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-key-20-free-pubg-thumbnail-collections-for-2024/"><u>[New] Key 20 Free PUBG Thumbnail Collections for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-evaluating-high-capacity-drives-how-many-vids-can-a-64128gb-hold-in-2024/"><u>[New] Evaluating High-Capacity Drives  How Many Vids Can a 64/128GB Hold, In 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/pushing-boundaries-with-intova-x-action-tech-for-2024/"><u>Pushing Boundaries with Intova X Action Tech for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/new-laptop-beautification-leading-website-walls/"><u>[New] Laptop Beautification  Leading Website Walls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-flac-converter-guide-finding-the-perfect-one-for-your-needs/"><u>Updated In 2024, FLAC Converter Guide Finding the Perfect One for Your Needs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-meet-mycam-cam-the-home-video-revolution-unfolding/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Meet MyCam Cam  The Home Video Revolution Unfolding</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-video-editing-replacing-audio-tracks-a-comprehensive-guide-part-1/"><u>Updated Mastering Video Editing Replacing Audio Tracks - A Comprehensive Guide (Part 1)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/n-2024-mastering-youtube-organizing-music-into-a-playlist/"><u>[New] In 2024, Mastering YouTube  Organizing Music Into a Playlist</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-10-facebook-jail-secrets-to-avoid-being-blocked-get-out-of-it/"><u>In 2024, 10 Facebook Jail Secrets to Avoid Being Blocked / Get Out of It</u></a></li><li><a href="https://pokemon-go-android.techidaily.com/3-ways-for-android-pokemon-go-spoofing-on-realme-narzo-n53-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>3 Ways for Android Pokemon Go Spoofing On Realme Narzo N53 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-from-novice-to-vlogger-the-top-10-editing-techniques/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  From Novice to Vlogger  The Top 10 Editing Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-innovate-brand-identity-complimentary-logo-templates-customization/"><u>[New] Innovate Brand Identity  Complimentary Logo Templates Customization</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Every time there is a new edition, Microsoft adds a bit more functionality and depth to provide the user an interesting experience. Microsoft gave users free access to its inventions by integrating Movie Makers’ most recent version inside its operating system. You may consult this guide for further information if you need a more modern service.</p><p>The Windows Movie Maker old version has had a ton of options, including music, narration, transition effects, and more. Since Microsoft no longer develops Movie Maker, there won’t be any new software upgrades. Microsoft created the program for laptops and desktop Windows PCs. To manipulate the multimedia clips that are on the right side of the screen, use the tabs. Your adjustments may be seen in the old Windows Movie Maker by using the UI’s left side.

Industry players didn’t really pay much attention to WMM since it didn’t provide enough features to compete with its rivals. Microsoft chose to produce version 1.1 after realizing WMM’s drawbacks. That version was made available at the same time as the Windows XP OS from Microsoft.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/windows-movie-maker-2000.jpg"                      alt="windows movie maker 2000"                ></p><p>For this, Windows Movie Maker’s first port was created.

As a stand-alone utility, Microsoft releases this product on the market. On August 19, 2009, Microsoft officially made it available as a standalone product. To create animated films, you may effortlessly import, edit, and save audio, picture, and video data using Live Movie Maker’s user-friendly interface.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Decoding-Virtual-Realm-Must-Know-Phrases"><a href="#Decoding-Virtual-Realm-Must-Know-Phrases" class="headerlink" title="Decoding Virtual Realm: Must-Know Phrases"></a>Decoding Virtual Realm: Must-Know Phrases</h2><h1 id="Virtual-Reality-Terms-You-Should-Know"><a href="#Virtual-Reality-Terms-You-Should-Know" class="headerlink" title="Virtual Reality Terms You Should Know"></a>Virtual Reality Terms You Should Know</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Benjamin-Arango"><a href="#Benjamin-Arango" class="headerlink" title="Benjamin Arango"></a>Benjamin Arango</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><h2 id="Motion-Platform"><a href="#Motion-Platform" class="headerlink" title="Motion Platform"></a>Motion Platform</h2><p>It is a kind of highly controlled physical system which assists in the simulation of display motion into the real motion senses in the VR world. It provides life to all captured digital elements and let users believe that they are playing with a world of all living things.</p><h2 id="Eye-Tracking"><a href="#Eye-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Eye Tracking"></a>Eye Tracking</h2><p>Eye Tracking works the same as that of head tracking and assists to keep users eye in motion as per the requirement of VR stuff. HMD assists in proper tracking of eye and head with integration to VR content, if you talk about VR games then this feature makes you feel the reality inside the gaming world and when you have to aim at targets then they can be controlled like real-world movements.</p><h2 id="Head-Tracking"><a href="#Head-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Head Tracking"></a>Head Tracking</h2><p>Here we are going to talk about the sensors that track the movement of users’ heads and keeps images moving in such a manner that they match head positions perfectly. For example, if you are using an Oculus Rift then the head tracking feature will force your head to look up, down, right, and left so that you can see the world in the way virtual reality wish to make you see.</p><h2 id="Motion-Tracking"><a href="#Motion-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Motion Tracking"></a>Motion Tracking</h2><p>It is described in terms of the ability to record all movements in such a manner that they appear to be a part of the real world. It will help you to get a closer look at every element that you want to observe in VR content, the same as that of real life. It is one of the biggest elements in the world of Virtual Reality that forces your senses to get involved with the tricky science of virtual environment with a feeling that you are wandering in a fantasy world.</p><h2 id="Refresh-Rate"><a href="#Refresh-Rate" class="headerlink" title="Refresh Rate"></a>Refresh Rate</h2><p>When you are looking at a series of images in the world of Virtual reality then refresh rate helps to control the movement of frames so that they can be managed to move at a faster or slower rate as per requirement. Refresh rate controls lead and lag of a series of images in such a manner that users avail a responsive experience. At the standard rate, users need 60 frames per second.</p><h2 id="Head-Mounted-Display-HMD"><a href="#Head-Mounted-Display-HMD" class="headerlink" title="Head Mounted Display (HMD)"></a>Head Mounted Display (HMD)</h2><p>This term will be more often used when you enter the world of Virtual Reality because it is associated with reading and hearing abilities in VR technology. In simple terms, HMDs are the specialized form of hardware that is responsible to deliver VR experience to users. It is designed in shape of a helmet or goggle that users can strap on their faces easily or can wear on their heads. The usage depends upon the requirements of your VR gear because some sensors work with head tracking whereas others do not need such elements.</p><h2 id="Latency"><a href="#Latency" class="headerlink" title="Latency"></a>Latency</h2><p>If you have ever experienced the world of Virtual Reality then you surely might have noticed that whenever you move your head in the directive motion then the visuals do not keep up accordingly, this is called latency. This is an unpleasant thing about Virtual Reality that adds a limitation to match virtual world with the real world. The lag caused by this latency period is a complaint from VR content users and it occurs due to a variety of reasons.</p><h2 id="Immersion"><a href="#Immersion" class="headerlink" title="Immersion"></a>Immersion</h2><p>The combination of VR and MR leads to immersive experience of users where high-end manipulations can be done on images, sounds as well as other stimuli so that they can stay alive in an artificial environment.</p><h2 id="Field-of-View-FOV"><a href="#Field-of-View-FOV" class="headerlink" title="Field of View (FOV)"></a>Field of View (FOV)</h2><p>The term Field of View presents the angle of the visual field in degrees where it is important to keep FoV higher to that immersion can be extended to a higher end of the scale. Technically, the viewing angle of the human eye reaches up to 200 degrees thus it becomes important to raise the angle of FoV so that higher immersion can be resulted.</p><h2 id="Screen-Resolution"><a href="#Screen-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Screen Resolution"></a>Screen Resolution</h2><p>Screen resolution actually describes the number of pixels to be displayed on-screen during Virtual Reality scenes. Same as the concept of television monitor or computer screen, more number of pixels mean much better resolution and much clearer as well as the realistic quality of images. The technology of Virtual Reality serves with awesome resolution and cameras developed for capturing such images are designed to add more number of pixels per frame. With specially developed VR headsets, the screen is divided into two portions that are observed by each eye separately and the screen door effects added to VR technology makes users feel like they are watching through a door.</p><h2 id="Virtual-Reality"><a href="#Virtual-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Virtual Reality"></a>Virtual Reality</h2><p>First of all, it is important to know the actual meaning of VR that stands for Virtual Reality. The VR immersion is actually achieved by mixing two most important senses of living beings that are vision as well as hearing; for this VR technology utilizes headphones and headsets. With VR environment you will feel real life in photographs also and the experience with memories will go amazing.</p><h2 id="Augmented-Reality"><a href="#Augmented-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Augmented Reality"></a>Augmented Reality</h2><p>It is simply the process of overlaying digital elements or data on the real world so that you can interact with reality and digital elements on same platform. Although Augmented Reality technology is still running behind Virtual Reality, the day they will converge then real wonders will be created with mixed reality effects.</p><h2 id="Mixed-Reality"><a href="#Mixed-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Mixed Reality"></a>Mixed Reality</h2><p>The convergence of Virtual and Augmented reality is known as mixed reality. MR creates a blend of the virtual world into the physical space and it has the power to bring life into digital elements resulted from highly advanced camera units and VR+AR gears.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/mastering-waveform-overlaps-the-crossfade-method/"><u>Mastering Waveform Overlaps  The Crossfade Method</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-cheapest-4k-dslrmirrorless-cameras-and-camcorders/"><u>2024 Approved  Cheapest 4K DSLR/Mirrorless Cameras and Camcorders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-unlock-the-power-of-time-markings-in-your-youtube-content/"><u>[New] Unlock the Power of Time Markings in Your YouTube Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-an-in-depth-guide-to-every-element-of-srt/"><u>[New] In 2024, An In-Depth Guide to Every Element of SRT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-switch-from-youtube-thumbnail-view-to-live-stream-for-2024/"><u>[New] Switch From YouTube Thumbnail View to Live Stream for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-from-obscurity-to-the-top-the-seo-playbook-for-podcasters/"><u>[New] From Obscurity to the Top  The SEO Playbook for Podcasters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-unmissable-vr-cinematic-journeys-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unmissable VR Cinematic Journeys for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unlocking-sierra-comprehensive-icloud-drives/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Unlocking Sierra  Comprehensive iCloud Drives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-wins-for-windows-11-users-for-2024/"><u>New Wins for Windows 11 Users for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-to-deal-with-the-infinix-smart-8-hd-screen-black-but-still-works-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>How To Deal With the Infinix Smart 8 HD Screen Black But Still Works? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-data-from-honor-play-7t-to-other-android-devices-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Data from Honor Play 7T to Other Android Devices? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-free-and-easy-building-attractive-youtube-intros-without-expense/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Free & Easy  Building Attractive YouTube Intros without Expense</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-premier-open-source-windowsmac-screenshots-and-recorders/"><u>[Updated] Premier Open-Source Windows/Mac Screenshots & Recorders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-macs-best-in-show-top-10-screenshot-utilities-unveiled-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mac's Best in Show  Top 10 Screenshot Utilities Unveiled for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-iphone-15-without-passcode-4-easy-methods-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How To Unlock iPhone 15 Without Passcode? 4 Easy Methods | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-swift-sharing-twitter-to-whatsapp-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Swift Sharing  Twitter to WhatsApp Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/cyberlink-screen-recorder-review/"><u>Cyberlink Screen Recorder Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-does-life360-notify-when-you-log-out-on-huawei-p60-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Does Life360 Notify When You Log Out On Huawei P60? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/best-pokemons-for-pvp-matches-in-pokemon-go-for-apple-iphone-xs-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>Best Pokemons for PVP Matches in Pokemon Go For Apple iPhone XS | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Starting from opening titles and ending credits to transition slides and text snippets, texts and titles always enhance video content. It is quite obvious that animated texts draw more attention than showing static text effects. If you are new to video editing and text animation, you should be aware of the common types of text animation.</p><p>You should use these common text animations in your videos because the viewers are already comfortable watching them. Apart from using them directly, you should use them to create some interesting and stunning text animations so that the video looks different from others.

Common Types of Text Animation"></a>Part 1. Common Types of Text Animation</h2><p>Here is the list of the common types of text animations that you usually see on social media videos as well as video streaming platforms. Using these common text animation types, various interesting and innovative text animations are created.</p><h3 id="1-Parallax-scrolling"><a href="#1-Parallax-scrolling" class="headerlink" title="1. Parallax scrolling"></a>1. Parallax scrolling</h3><p>Parallax scrolling is a popular visual effect whereby the background stays the same while the foreground shifts horizontally. In a text animation, the parallax scrolling effect is where the background box moves from bottom to top and vice versa but the text stays the same all the time.</p><h3 id="2-Fade-in-and-fade-out"><a href="#2-Fade-in-and-fade-out" class="headerlink" title="2. Fade in and fade out"></a>2. Fade in and fade out</h3><p>Fade in and fade out text animation is extremely common in videos where the text slowly appears on the screen and its color brightness increase slowly. After reaching its full brightness, the text slowly loses its brightness and finally vanishes completely. Generally, the words appear and disappear simultaneously but in the modern effect, the characters appear and disappear individually at different times for more visual impact.</p><h3 id="3-Sliding-text-animation"><a href="#3-Sliding-text-animation" class="headerlink" title="3. Sliding text animation"></a>3. Sliding text animation</h3><p>You must have noticed the sliding text animation in videos where facts and figures are shown on the video. The sliding text animation generally slides into the video frame from a border or a stripe. Thereafter, it vanishes into the border or the stripe from where it originated. Sometimes, the text slides in from the right and sits in a fixed highlighted box, and slides out eventually.</p><h3 id="4-Text-breaks-away-animation"><a href="#4-Text-breaks-away-animation" class="headerlink" title="4. Text breaks away animation"></a>4. Text breaks away animation</h3><p>There are different variations of text breaks away animation but it is one of the most visually appealing text animations.

The file size is unknown until you have the completed produced video. The terms 20MB and 20Mb are not interchangeable.</p><p>The problem is that a 30-second iPhone recording might easily exceed 100MB in size. 1024 MB or less than 20 minutes. What is the length of a video that is 25 megabytes?</p><p>At 30 frames per second, a raw HD video will require 5MBx30 150MB of storage space. Does anyone know how many MB a 30-second VGA video at 30 frames per second would take up on a memory stick?</p><p> For the raw footage, we’ll need roughly 540GB per hour.</p><p>Bits per second (bps) is the unit of measurement for network transmissions. Even if you have a premium Nitro account, you cannot upload long videos larger than 20MB. - 1080p video size: 258 MB</p><p>As a result, 20MBps is 160Mbps. 1024 bytes per kilobyte. I’d have to look into what kind of file that is.</p><p>How long does a 25MB video last? Each uncompressed frame is approximately 5MB in size.</p><p>Once you have the file size, all you have to do is guess how many times it will be seen. The video file size formula can now be used to address how to compute video file size. TVs that stream video.</p><p>A DVD with excellent quality content holds 47 gigabytes, or little more than 2. I’m using a laptop as a projector, but I also need it to connect to a second TV. 8 Mbps Youtube HD 1080p25</p><p>30 frames per second vs 15 fps. Depending on the aforementioned, a 30-second video could be anywhere from 1 to 30 megabytes. The 400 MB video file will download in less than 11 minutes over a. - 25 Mb seconds.</p><p>If the video is only 2 or 3 minutes long, you should be able to compress the file size significantly. That means one frame in a 4K video file with an 8-bit Bit Depth is 84375 MB in size. Alternatively, 20Mbps is 25MBps.</p><p>That is 20 megabits per second. As a result, many people worry if they can transfer large films through Discord without Nitro. The LG smart television turns on for a few seconds before turning off.</p><p>Many of our storage drives are incapable of writing to disk at that speed. Seconds of 20MB video When I try to edit my video in a video editor, it claims that the resolution is not supported. As a result, 1 minute 60 seconds.</p><p>So 70778880 bits &#x3D; 84375 MB (8 x 1024 × 1024 MB). What is the maximum video length that can be uploaded on Facebook? 25md is equal to how many seconds of video.</p><p>- 1 minute, 25-megabyte video. How many megabytes are there? 3200 Mb 5 Mbps download time</p><p>A minute is equal to 60 seconds. I make 30 seconds 320 x 240 videos that are roughly 12 MB in size.</p><p><strong>How to create a longer video in a 20Mb video (introduce Filmora to change video bitrate or resolution to create a longer video)</strong></p><p>When exporting video, you may have come across the term “bitrate” on occasion. Then you’re probably wondering what bitrate is. Is it related to the quality of my video? Don’t be concerned. Many readers, including yourself, have similar reservations.</p><p>We will explain what video bitrate is and how video bitrate and quality are related in this article. Finally, we’ll show you how to alter the video bitrate as a bonus and have a longer video. Continue to read!</p><p><strong>What is the bitrate of the video?</strong></p><p>The entire amount of video data transferred in a given period is known as the video bitrate. To put it another way, each video file has its own set of data that must be sent in order to play it on multiple devices. Video bitrate is the pace at which this data is conveyed over a certain time interval. Video bitrate is usually expressed in bits per second (bps). It’s also important to remember that videos with a higher bitrate typically have a greater file size.</p><p><strong>Does higher video bitrate mean better video quality?</strong></p><p>When looking at the same video with the same resolution, a greater bitrate will accommodate higher image quality in the video output. Bitrates are projected to increase when the resolution is increased and more data is handled.</p><p>As a result, while a high video bitrate can give amazing quality, it can also put a lot of load on your hardware, causing stutters.</p><p><strong>How to change the bitrate of a video in Filmora</strong></p><p>Filmora can be used to change the bitrate of video files.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Conquering-Low-Light-with-iPhone’s-Advanced-HDR-Techniques"><a href="#Conquering-Low-Light-with-iPhone’s-Advanced-HDR-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Conquering Low Light with iPhone’s Advanced HDR Techniques"></a>Conquering Low Light with iPhone’s Advanced HDR Techniques</h2><p>Are you annoyed that your iPhone camera is unable to capture what your eyes see? Well, no need to waste your energy. The iPhone camera offers just the perfect feature to counter this problem - the HDR feature.</p><p>Most people have to use photo editing software to fix the exposures of photos, but luckily for us, we don’t need that.</p><p>In this article, we will give you a brief overview of HDR photography and then guide you on how to shoot HDR photos with an iPhone.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-HDR-Photography-for-iPhone"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-HDR-Photography-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is HDR Photography for iPhone?"></a>Part 1: What is HDR Photography for iPhone?</h2><p>HDR is short for High Dynamic Range, and it refers to a photography technique where multiple exposures of a scene are combined to create one well-lit picture. It captures a scene’s darkest and lightest tone and shows them as such in the final photo.</p><p>Apple introduced the HDR feature back in 2010 on iPhone 4. It was a breakthrough for the company, further enhancing the iPhone camera. Since then, all the succeeding models of the iPhone have the HDR feature.</p><p>However, Apple has advanced its HDR technology with the passage of time. Before the release of the iPhone 12, Apple worked with HDR10. With the iPhone 12, Apple inculcated Dolby Vision HDR, becoming the first to roll out Dolby Vision in a mobile handset.</p><p>Without the HDR feature, your iPhone camera is not capable of capturing a high-contrast scene. This will lead you to having exposure problems in your pictures.</p><p>Your scene might have dark tones that are well exposed with the right colors and details, but the bright areas might be over-exposed with no shade or detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-1.jpg"                      alt="hdr shoot"                ></p><p>On the other hand, your scene might have bright tones that are well-exposed with the right color and details, but the dark areas are too dark to show the details.</p><p>Alt text: HDR shoot with different exposure</p><p>With the iPhone’s HDR feature, you can get a perfectly exposed photo showing details simultaneously in light and dark tones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-2.jpg"                      alt="hdr shoot with different exposure"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-take-an-HDR-Photo-with-your-iPhone-Camera"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-take-an-HDR-Photo-with-your-iPhone-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to take an HDR Photo with your iPhone Camera?"></a>Part 2: How to take an HDR Photo with your iPhone Camera?</h2><p>Now that we know how HDR helps make our pictures pop out, let’s look at how you can take an HDR photo with your iPhone camera.</p><h3 id="How-to-take-HDR-photos-on-iPhone-X-iPhone-11-models-and-iPhone-12-models"><a href="#How-to-take-HDR-photos-on-iPhone-X-iPhone-11-models-and-iPhone-12-models" class="headerlink" title="How to take HDR photos on iPhone X, iPhone 11 models, and iPhone 12 models?"></a>How to take HDR photos on iPhone X, iPhone 11 models, and iPhone 12 models?</h3><p>Here is a step-by-step guide for you to follow. This guide is applicable for iPhone XS, iPhone XR, iPhone 11 models, and iPhone 12 models.</p><h5 id="Step1Go-to-Settings"><a href="#Step1Go-to-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step1Go to Settings"></a>Step1Go to Settings</h5><p>The first step for you is to go to your iPhone Settings. Here, click on the Camera app.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-3.jpg"                      alt="go to settings and click on camera"                ></p><h5 id="Step2Adjust-the-Settings"><a href="#Step2Adjust-the-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step2Adjust the Settings"></a>Step2Adjust the Settings</h5><p>Here, ensure that the Smart HDR (or Auto HDR in iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X) is toggled off. The HDR option will not be available in the camera if you do not switch this off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-4.jpg"                      alt="turn on smart hdr"                ></p><p>Also, ensure that the “Keep Normal Photo” toggle is on. Having this enabled will let your camera save a non-HDR version of the photo as well as the HDR version.</p><h5 id="Step3Head-to-the-Camera-App"><a href="#Step3Head-to-the-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="Step3Head to the Camera App"></a>Step3Head to the Camera App</h5><p>Once you have adjusted the setting, open the Camera app.</p><h5 id="Step4Enable-HDR"><a href="#Step4Enable-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Step4Enable HDR"></a>Step4Enable HDR</h5><p>At the top of the screen, you will see an HDR option. Tap on it to enable (or disable) it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone-5.jpg"                      alt="go the camera and click on hrd from top menu"                ></p><p>In older iPhones such as iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and earlier, you have the option to set it to Auto, On, or Off. Choose the “On” option.</p><p>You can now take HDR photos with your iPhone!</p><h3 id="How-to-take-HDR-Photos-on-iPhone-13"><a href="#How-to-take-HDR-Photos-on-iPhone-13" class="headerlink" title="How to take HDR Photos on iPhone 13?"></a>How to take HDR Photos on iPhone 13?</h3><p>In the iPhone 13 models, the steps for taking an HDR photo are slightly different. The first few steps are the same. Go to Settings &gt; Camera. Under the HDR section, find the “HDR” option and turn the toggle on.</p><p>Once the toggle is on, go to the Camera app. You will see the HDR option where you can turn it On&#x2F;Off or set it to Automatic.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Not-to-Have-Two-Same-Photos-When-Shot-with-HDR-on-your-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-Not-to-Have-Two-Same-Photos-When-Shot-with-HDR-on-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Not to Have Two Same Photos When Shot with HDR on your iPhone?"></a>Part 3: How Not to Have Two Same Photos When Shot with HDR on your iPhone?</h2><p>You may notice that when you shoot photos with HDR on your iPhone, your camera roll shows two identical pictures. This happens when the “Keep Normal Photo” setting is enabled in the iPhone Camera Settings. This setting is only available on iPhone X and earlier.</p><p>For the latest versions, you can only see the Smart HDR option. By default, Smart HDR does not save the non-HDR version of the image.</p><p>The “Keep Normal Photo” option is helpful in instances where you might have to compare the HDR and non-HDR versions. You may even prefer the non-HDR version in some cases.</p><p>But the side effect of this feature is that it becomes a nuisance to delete the other versions, and it also takes up space.</p><p>Here is how you can disable this setting and avoid having two same photos.</p><h5 id="Step1Go-to-Settings-1"><a href="#Step1Go-to-Settings-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1Go to Settings"></a>Step1Go to Settings</h5><p>Go to your iPhone Settings and tap on the Camera app.</p><h5 id="Step2Disable-the-“Keep-Normal-Photo”-Option"><a href="#Step2Disable-the-“Keep-Normal-Photo”-Option" class="headerlink" title="Step2Disable the “Keep Normal Photo” Option"></a>Step2Disable the “Keep Normal Photo” Option</h5><p>You will see a “Keep Normal Photo” toggle in the HDR panel. Turn the toggle off.</p><p>Once the toggle is off, you can go and take an HDR photo. The camera app will no longer save the non-HDR version of the image.</p><h2 id="Part-4-iPhone-Camera-Smart-HDR-Not-Working-Why"><a href="#Part-4-iPhone-Camera-Smart-HDR-Not-Working-Why" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: iPhone Camera Smart HDR Not Working, Why?"></a>Part 4: iPhone Camera Smart HDR Not Working, Why?</h2><p>The iPhone’s HDR option enables you to get great shots. Apple introduced a “Smart HDR” option on iPhone where the camera shoots photos in HDR (when necessary) by default. This option ensures that users don’t have to go to great lengths to get amazing shots.</p><p>However, there may be instances when you feel that the “Smart HDR” option is not working.</p><h3 id="Scenario-1-No-HDR-toggle-option-in-the-Camera-App"><a href="#Scenario-1-No-HDR-toggle-option-in-the-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="Scenario 1: No HDR toggle option in the Camera App"></a><strong>Scenario 1: No HDR toggle option in the Camera App</strong></h3><p>There may be a case where you open your Camera app to take a picture in HDR but there is no HDR option available to you. This is usually the case with iPhone 13 models, and its pro variants.</p><p>Well, the reason behind it is that Apple has added a new feature in these models that the Camera is set to capture HDR shots by default. So, users do not have the option to control the HDR feature.</p><p>It certainly takes away the control that users had in their shots because not all HDR images turn out to be perfect. Especially while zooming into things, the images start looking like a painting. However, it works just fine in most cases.</p><h3 id="Scenario-2-No-HDR-feature-for-Photos-enabled-in-iPhone-XS-Max"><a href="#Scenario-2-No-HDR-feature-for-Photos-enabled-in-iPhone-XS-Max" class="headerlink" title="Scenario 2: No HDR feature for Photos enabled in iPhone XS Max"></a><strong>Scenario 2: No HDR feature for Photos enabled in iPhone XS Max</strong></h3><p>Certain iPhone XS Max users are facing a problem where the Photos app does not show whether the image is an HDR image or not. Previously, users could see an “HDR” tag on their photos. However, recently the tags are not visible anymore.</p><p>Worry not, this does not mean that your Smart HDR is not working. You can check this by disabling Smart HDR from Settings &gt; Camera. Once Smart HDR is disabled, go to the Camera app and take a picture without HDR. Compare the before and after images to see if your HDR feature is working or not.</p><p>Such instances of Smart HDR may occur but you don’t need to worry too much about them. The simple solutions mentioned above will surely fix your problem. In case they don’t help, you can contact the Apple Support to get your queries resolved.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Video-Guide-HDR-on-your-iPhone-device"><a href="#Part-5-Video-Guide-HDR-on-your-iPhone-device" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Video Guide HDR on your iPhone device"></a>Part 5: Video Guide HDR on your iPhone device</h2><p>HDR photography is a really cool technique that can really make your content more appealing.

It’s one of the world’s most extensive podcast streaming services. So how did it get there? And how can you get on the platform yourself?</p><p>This article dives deep into Apple’s podcast strategy. It includes how to submit to Apple Podcasts, why you should and how to improve your chances of getting on the platform.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Prepare-Your-Show-for-Apple-Podcast-Submission"><a href="#Part-1-Prepare-Your-Show-for-Apple-Podcast-Submission" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Prepare Your Show for Apple Podcast Submission"></a>Part 1. Prepare Your Show for Apple Podcast Submission</h2><p>Apple Podcasts submission is an excellent opportunity to earn severe exposure to your podcast. It would be best to start by sending your show to Apple for review. Then, we’ll help you with the steps to get your podcast accepted on Apple Podcasts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Apple Podcasts is not a podcast-hosting site. You’re not uploading your audio files to Apple. Instead, you’re telling Apple where to find your audio files on the web. Apple finds your files via an RSS feed that links to your hosting site.</p><h3 id="Publish-an-episode-on-a-hosting-site"><a href="#Publish-an-episode-on-a-hosting-site" class="headerlink" title="Publish an episode on a hosting site"></a>Publish an episode on a hosting site</h3><p>The first requirement of Apple Podcasts is a published episode. You need to give Apple a list to start. It can be a trailer or your first podcast episode posted on a hosting site. You can use any hosting service to publish your episode. One of the best is <a class="link"   href="https://www.buzzsprout.com/" >buzzsprout <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which offers hosting services, promotion, and marketing opportunities for podcasters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/apple-podcast-submit-1.jpg"                      alt="buzzsprout website"                ></p><p>A podcast hosting site stores your podcast files and distributes them to various podcast streaming platforms using an RSS feed. Your hosting site will automatically submit your podcast to podcast streaming platforms. But with the Apple podcast, you will have to submit manually only once.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Submit-Podcasts-to-Apple-Podcasts"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Submit-Podcasts-to-Apple-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How To Submit Podcasts to Apple Podcasts?"></a>Part 2. How To Submit Podcasts to Apple Podcasts?</h2><p>If you’re not submitting your podcast to Apple Podcasts, you’re missing out on the opportunity to earn revenue from ads and sponsorships. So we set out to find the easiest way to submit a podcast to Apple Podcasts and make it easy for everyone else.</p><p>After publishing your first episode to a podcast hosting site, there are a few required fields that you can find on settings:</p><ul><li>Podcast description</li><li>Podcast artwork (square)</li><li>Apple Podcasts category</li><li>Language selection</li><li>Explicit checkbox</li></ul><p>It’s time to submit your show to Apple Podcasts.</p><p>Step1 Go to Apple Podcasts directory instructions in Buzzsprout and click ‘Get listed.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/apple-podcast-submit-2.jpg"                      alt="click get listed"                ></p><p>Step2 You can see that we have already done steps 1 and 2, according to Apple. Now scroll down, and you’ll find your RSS feed URL. Copy your unique URL and click the ‘Launch Apple Podcasts Connect Website’ button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/apple-podcast-submit-3.jpg"                      alt="copy your rss feed url"                ></p><p>Step3 You’ll be redirected to Apple Podcasts login website. You can put your existing Apple id or create a new one by clicking on ‘Create your now.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/apple-podcast-submit-4.jpg"                      alt="apple podcasts login"                ></p><p>Step4 Once logged in, go to the ‘Podcasts +’ sign on the top left. Click the purple + sign and then click the ‘New Show.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/apple-podcast-submit-5.jpg"                      alt="click new show"                ></p><p>Step5 After clicking on the new show, a window will appear, giving you two options. Click on the option that says, ‘Add a show with an RSS feed,’ and click next. Then it asks for an ‘RSS Feed URL.’ Paste the RSS feed URL you copied from buzzsprout and click ‘Add.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/apple-podcast-submit-6.jpg"                      alt="choose a show type"                ></p><p>Step6 Once the RSS feed is added, the Apple Podcasts app will fetch all of the information related to that link. It will take a few minutes, but once it’s fetched, you can validate it and save it. Finally, click ‘Submit For Review’ to get verified. After 72 hours, you can see your podcasts listed in Apple Podcasts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/apple-podcast-submit-7.jpg"                      alt="click submit for review"                ></p><h3 id="Technical-requirements-for-RSS-feed"><a href="#Technical-requirements-for-RSS-feed" class="headerlink" title="Technical requirements for RSS feed"></a>Technical requirements for RSS feed</h3><p>Apple requires podcasts to comply with specific technical requirements and to provide quality content to provide an excellent experience for their listeners. Here are some requirements for an RSS feed from Apple:</p><ul><li>Show artwork and allow streaming playback of your episodes.</li><li>RSS feed URLs must be publicly addressable.</li><li>Only ASCII filenames and URLs.</li><li>All episodes must contain a GUID, which never changes.</li><li>Each episode must have a unique <enclosure> tag and its three required components — URL, length, and type.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Why-Get-Feed-Validation-Errors"><a href="#Part-3-Why-Get-Feed-Validation-Errors" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Why Get Feed Validation Errors?"></a>Part 3. Why Get Feed Validation Errors?</h2><p>Validation errors occur when the RSS feed isn’t formatted correctly or contains something it shouldn’t.</p><h3 id="Invalid-characters"><a href="#Invalid-characters" class="headerlink" title="Invalid characters"></a>Invalid characters</h3><p>An invalid feed is often caused by one or more “invalid” characters that need to be removed or edited—for example, using a series of dashes “-“ in the description to create a line break or an episode file that contains characters other than 0-1, a-z, or A-Z.</p><h3 id="Formatted-incorrect"><a href="#Formatted-incorrect" class="headerlink" title="Formatted incorrect"></a>Formatted incorrect</h3><p>An episode file uploaded using a file type that isn’t supported by Apple Podcasts and other podcast listening platforms. We recommend uploading audio files as MP3 files and video episodes as MP4 files.</p><p>Well, there are two ways to reach the root cause:</p><ul><li>Troubleshoot a failed validation by external tools. There are many to choose from, like Cast Feed Validator and Podbase Podcast Validator.</li><li>Get help from hosting providers. We suggest checking your hosting provider’s support forums or contacting the original hosting platform for assistance. They usually provide service with setting up RSS feeds.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Best-Practices-for-Submitting-a-Podcast-to-Apple-Podcasts"><a href="#Part-4-Best-Practices-for-Submitting-a-Podcast-to-Apple-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Best Practices for Submitting a Podcast to Apple Podcasts"></a>Part 4. Best Practices for Submitting a Podcast to Apple Podcasts</h2><p>Your podcast submission may seem like a hassle at first, but once you have all of your materials organized and submitted, it will be much easier. By following these best practices for submitting a podcast to Apple Podcasts, you’ll be well on your way to achieving podcasting success.</p><h3 id="Fill-out-RSS-feed-data"><a href="#Fill-out-RSS-feed-data" class="headerlink" title="Fill out RSS feed data"></a>Fill out RSS feed data</h3><p>One big mistake people make when filling out RSS feed data is failing to do so. The problem is that many RSS readers can only read the feeds you have specified. Therefore, if you do not fill out all the required fields, it will not show up to your reader.</p><p>That is the most important practice you need to do. Make sure you put the data that Apple Podcasts requires in there.</p><h3 id="Compelling-description"><a href="#Compelling-description" class="headerlink" title="Compelling description"></a>Compelling description</h3><p>The description of your podcast is one of the first things people see, and it’s also one of the last things people see before downloading. For a listener to give the episode a second look, they first need to know that it’s something they should listen to. Therefore, it would be best to make a compelling description to convince someone to listen to your show.</p><p>Some basic rules of thumb for writing a good description:</p><ul><li>Include a clear subject line.</li><li>Introduce your topic.</li><li>Explain how the episode relates to the rest of your show.</li></ul><h3 id="Bold-cover-art"><a href="#Bold-cover-art" class="headerlink" title="Bold cover art"></a>Bold cover art</h3><p>A simple way to add personality to your podcast is by using bold cover art. It shows that you care about the quality of your audio content, and the image communicates your message. The cover art should be proactive and distinctive but subtle enough not to distract from the show itself.</p><p>Remember that most people use mobile devices to browse podcasts. That means your cover art must be easily readable on small screens. So having minimal text with large fonts is the best option.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Apple has been criticized by podcasters who claim that Apple’s podcast submission process is complex, confusing, and challenging to navigate. So that’s where we come in.</p><p>This article discusses what it takes to get featured on the Apple Podcasts podcast directory. We discuss what it means to get featured on Apple Podcasts, why you should be submitting your show, and why it’s worth it.</p><h3 id="Publish-an-episode-on-a-hosting-site-1"><a href="#Publish-an-episode-on-a-hosting-site-1" class="headerlink" title="Publish an episode on a hosting site"></a>Publish an episode on a hosting site</h3><p>The first requirement of Apple Podcasts is a published episode.

Here are some requirements for an RSS feed from Apple:</p><ul><li>Show artwork and allow streaming playback of your episodes.</li><li>RSS feed URLs must be publicly addressable.</li><li>Only ASCII filenames and URLs.</li><li>All episodes must contain a GUID, which never changes.</li><li>Each episode must have a unique <enclosure> tag and its three required components — URL, length, and type.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Why-Get-Feed-Validation-Errors-1"><a href="#Part-3-Why-Get-Feed-Validation-Errors-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Why Get Feed Validation Errors?"></a>Part 3. Why Get Feed Validation Errors?</h2><p>Validation errors occur when the RSS feed isn’t formatted correctly or contains something it shouldn’t.</p><h3 id="Invalid-characters-1"><a href="#Invalid-characters-1" class="headerlink" title="Invalid characters"></a>Invalid characters</h3><p>An invalid feed is often caused by one or more “invalid” characters that need to be removed or edited—for example, using a series of dashes “-“ in the description to create a line break or an episode file that contains characters other than 0-1, a-z, or A-Z.</p><h3 id="Formatted-incorrect-1"><a href="#Formatted-incorrect-1" class="headerlink" title="Formatted incorrect"></a>Formatted incorrect</h3><p>An episode file uploaded using a file type that isn’t supported by Apple Podcasts and other podcast listening platforms. We recommend uploading audio files as MP3 files and video episodes as MP4 files.</p><p>Well, there are two ways to reach the root cause:</p><ul><li>Troubleshoot a failed validation by external tools. There are many to choose from, like Cast Feed Validator and Podbase Podcast Validator.</li><li>Get help from hosting providers. We suggest checking your hosting provider’s support forums or contacting the original hosting platform for assistance. They usually provide service with setting up RSS feeds.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Best-Practices-for-Submitting-a-Podcast-to-Apple-Podcasts-1"><a href="#Part-4-Best-Practices-for-Submitting-a-Podcast-to-Apple-Podcasts-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Best Practices for Submitting a Podcast to Apple Podcasts"></a>Part 4. Best Practices for Submitting a Podcast to Apple Podcasts</h2><p>Your podcast submission may seem like a hassle at first, but once you have all of your materials organized and submitted, it will be much easier. By following these best practices for submitting a podcast to Apple Podcasts, you’ll be well on your way to achieving podcasting success.</p><h3 id="Fill-out-RSS-feed-data-1"><a href="#Fill-out-RSS-feed-data-1" class="headerlink" title="Fill out RSS feed data"></a>Fill out RSS feed data</h3><p>One big mistake people make when filling out RSS feed data is failing to do so. The problem is that many RSS readers can only read the feeds you have specified. Therefore, if you do not fill out all the required fields, it will not show up to your reader.</p><p>That is the most important practice you need to do. Make sure you put the data that Apple Podcasts requires in there.</p><h3 id="Compelling-description-1"><a href="#Compelling-description-1" class="headerlink" title="Compelling description"></a>Compelling description</h3><p>The description of your podcast is one of the first things people see, and it’s also one of the last things people see before downloading. For a listener to give the episode a second look, they first need to know that it’s something they should listen to. Therefore, it would be best to make a compelling description to convince someone to listen to your show.</p><p>Some basic rules of thumb for writing a good description:</p><ul><li>Include a clear subject line.</li><li>Introduce your topic.</li><li>Explain how the episode relates to the rest of your show.</li></ul><h3 id="Bold-cover-art-1"><a href="#Bold-cover-art-1" class="headerlink" title="Bold cover art"></a>Bold cover art</h3><p>A simple way to add personality to your podcast is by using bold cover art. It shows that you care about the quality of your audio content, and the image communicates your message. The cover art should be proactive and distinctive but subtle enough not to distract from the show itself.</p><p>Remember that most people use mobile devices to browse podcasts. That means your cover art must be easily readable on small screens. So having minimal text with large fonts is the best option.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Apple has been criticized by podcasters who claim that Apple’s podcast submission process is complex, confusing, and challenging to navigate.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Comparing-the-Best-in-Class-for-4K-Screen-Reality"><a href="#Comparing-the-Best-in-Class-for-4K-Screen-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Comparing the Best in Class for 4K Screen Reality"></a>Comparing the Best in Class for 4K Screen Reality</h2><h1 id="Projector-vs-TV-Which-is-best-for-your-4K-experience"><a href="#Projector-vs-TV-Which-is-best-for-your-4K-experience" class="headerlink" title="Projector vs TV: Which is best for your 4K experience"></a>Projector vs TV: Which is best for your 4K experience</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Max-Wales"><a href="#Max-Wales" class="headerlink" title="Max Wales"></a>Max Wales</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> In its relatively short history, 4K home theater projectors and 4K TVs have significantly changed the world of home entertainment. The quality and size of the pictures today are better than ever before, and the possibility to enjoy near perfect image quality from the comfort of your own home has never been more accessible to the mainstream audience. Still, there is one important question that remains unanswered. Does a projector provide a better 4K experience than the 4K TV? Most people who face the projector VS TV dilemma are just looking for the best home entertainment experience, so here are some information that can help you make your own choice.</p><h2 id="4K-Projectors-Vs-4K-TVs"><a href="#4K-Projectors-Vs-4K-TVs" class="headerlink" title="4K Projectors Vs 4K TVs"></a>4K Projectors Vs 4K TVs</h2><h4 id="1-Resolution"><a href="#1-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="1.  Resolution"></a>1.  Resolution</h4><p> When you are buying a 4K TV there is very little doubt whether or not it is indeed a 4K TV. If the screen resolution is 3840 X 2160 then you are looking at the 4K Ultra HD TV, anything short of that is no longer a 4K TV. With TVs that have a resolution as high as this, you can be sure that all 4K or HDR content is designed to fit perfectly on its screen, while things are a little bit different with 4K projectors.</p><p> Many of the 4K projectors are not exactly that because they offer a pseudo 4K resolution through pixel interpolation. To make things even worse, most of the projectors offer only the ability to read and display 4K content, through native Full HD image sensor. If you are not looking to buy a high-end 4K projector make sure that the item you wish to purchase has a true 4K capability.</p><h4 id="2-Brightness-and-Contrast"><a href="#2-Brightness-and-Contrast" class="headerlink" title="2.  Brightness and Contrast"></a>2.  Brightness and Contrast</h4><p> If you ever watched a movie in a cinema you know that projectors need dark rooms to deliver their best performance. The image brightness, 4K projectors designed for home entertainment, can deliver is largely dependent on the light conditions of the room. But even in the perfect conditions of a darkened room, most projectors can’t generate the same level of the projection brightness as a 4K TV.</p><p> On the other hand, most projectors have overall better contrast ratios than the one generated on the screen of a 4K HDR TV, with the exception of TVs that feature OLED technology.</p><h4 id="3-Colors"><a href="#3-Colors" class="headerlink" title="3.  Colors"></a>3.  Colors</h4><p> Projector vs 4K TV dilemma becomes slightly more complicated when it comes to colors since both 4K TVs and 4K HDR projectors deliver stunningly vibrant colors. In addition, both of these device types are capable of displaying 90% of the HDR color space and cover more than 1.07 billion color shades.</p><p> Even though the colors look more vivid on 4K TVs solely because of its huge brightness advantage over the projectors, 4K HDR projectors still offer a somewhat wider color space and coverage.</p><h4 id="4-Picture-Display"><a href="#4-Picture-Display" class="headerlink" title="4.  Picture Display"></a>4.  Picture Display</h4><p> There is no question that projectors have a clear advantage over TVs when it comes to picture display. You can adjust the size of the picture by changing the projector’s distance from the surface you want to project the pictures to and you can choose on which surface you want to project pictures. Projection screens usually do the trick, although there might be some research involved related to the room characteristics since you need to know the dimensions of the wall and the room size so you can place the projector at the optimum distance from the screen.</p><p> With 4K TVs, you may not get a huge picture display, but the conditions you have to meet in order to enjoy 4K images are much simpler.</p><h4 id="5-Audio"><a href="#5-Audio" class="headerlink" title="5.  Audio"></a>5.  Audio</h4><p> All 4K TVs have their own speakers that are more than enough to enjoy the 4K footage you want to watch on your TV. Some models of 4K projectors can have speakers, but because of the position of the projector, they are often behind and above you which doesn’t bode well for the audio performance. Most 4K projectors require a setup that includes several external speakers to enable an enjoyable viewing experience.</p><p> Furthermore, 4K TV’s are much easier to connect with audio devices and you can control the setup with the TV’s remote which makes your home entertainment experience much more comfortable.</p><h4 id="6-Installation"><a href="#6-Installation" class="headerlink" title="6.  Installation"></a>6.  Installation</h4><p> Setting up a 4K TV is very simple. All you need to do is to find an elevated flat surface on which you wish to place the TV, plug it into the nearest electrical socket and turn it on. If you wish to connect your TV to your desktop computer or your stereo system you might need to get a few more cables, but that is where your troubles end.</p><p> Unfortunately the same cannot be said for 4K projectors because you first need to find the right distance from the projection screen, then you must connect it to a computer or video playback device and finally you need to adjust picture sharpness that is directly related to the distance from the projection screen. In terms of simplicity and the amount of time needed for installation the projector VS 4K TV, dilemma seems to be non-existent</p><h4 id="7-Viewing-experience"><a href="#7-Viewing-experience" class="headerlink" title="7.  Viewing experience"></a>7.  Viewing experience</h4><p> For some people, at least the experience of having a 4K projector in your home may be reminiscent of watching a movie in the theater. Also, the projected images might be lighter on the eyes, but if you are thinking about getting a 4K projector bear in mind that you’ll need additional equipment to have the best possible viewing experience.</p><p> 4K TV’s provide less immersive experience than the 4K projectors, however, with so many models available with the size of more than 60 inches that provide crisp and vivid colors the experience of watching a movie or any other 4K content is nothing short of superb.</p><h4 id="8-Cost"><a href="#8-Cost" class="headerlink" title="8.  Cost"></a>8.  Cost</h4><p> 4K projectors vs 4K TVs comparison is not hard to make when it comes to price because projectors are much more expensive. Even the Full HD, 2K projectors that can play 4K content cost between $3.000 and 5.000$, while home entertainment projectors with native 4K resolution don’t cost less than $10.000.</p><p> 4K TVs are much more affordable since you can purchase a new 60-inch model for approximately $2.000. The image quality of 4K projectors simply doesn’t justify their price.</p><h2 id="Winner-4K-TV"><a href="#Winner-4K-TV" class="headerlink" title="Winner - 4K TV"></a>Winner - 4K TV</h2><p> The high price, relatively complicated setup, additional equipment that is required for a perfect home entertainment experience make the 4K projection VS 4K TV showdown incredibly unfair because 4K TVs are simply better in each and every of these aspects. Perhaps the best option is to have both a projector and a 4K TV, but if your budget is limited and you can’t spare $3000 or much more for a 4K projector, we suggest that TV is much better option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-unleashing-potential-pilots-choice-top-10-drone-must-haves/"><u>[Updated] Unleashing Potential  Pilot's Choice - Top 10 Drone Must-Haves</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-swiftly-blur-your-iphone-shots-with-these-4-tricks-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Swiftly Blur Your iPhone Shots with These 4 Tricks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-fusionflicker-compiling-media-on-sierra-screens/"><u>[Updated] FusionFlicker  Compiling Media on Sierra Screens</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-high-quality-cameras-ideal-for-podcasts-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] High-Quality Cameras Ideal for Podcasts for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-crafting-captivating-presentations-by-adding-tunes/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Crafting Captivating Presentations by Adding Tunes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/top-5-android-clippers-essential-image-editing-apps/"><u>Top 5 Android Clippers  Essential Image Editing Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-global-communicators-guide-to-the-best-19-translation-apps/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  The Global Communicator’s Guide to the Best 19 Translation Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-zipping-and-textifying-a-guide-to-crafting-srt-from-zip/"><u>[Updated] Zipping and Textifying  A Guide to Crafting Srt From Zip</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/unlocking-the-full-potential-of-iphones-hdr-capabilities-for-2024/"><u>Unlocking the Full Potential of iPhone's HDR Capabilities for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-step-by-step-guide-to-flawless-audio-segmentation-for-2024/"><u>[New] Step-by-Step Guide to Flawless Audio Segmentation for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-innovating-visual-storytelling-utilizing-dslr-for-facebook-live-through-personal-devices-for-2024/"><u>[New] Innovating Visual Storytelling  Utilizing DSLR for Facebook LIVE Through Personal Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/unveiling-hdrs-impact-on-improved-video-workflow-for-2024/"><u>Unveiling HDR's Impact on Improved Video Workflow for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-28-practical-tips-for-streaming-online-courses-on-a-budget/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  28 Practical Tips for Streaming Online Courses on a Budget</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/8-tips-on-how-to-vlog-confidently-like-popular-youtubers/"><u>8 Tips on How to Vlog Confidently Like Popular YouTubers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/pure-visual-snapshot-of-your-display/"><u>Pure Visual Snapshot of Your Display</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/2024-approved-top-whatsapp-status-creator-tools/"><u>2024 Approved Top WhatsApp Status Creator Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-vdieo-software.techidaily.com/unleash-creativity-with-the-best-resource-friendly-video-editors/"><u>Unleash Creativity with the Best Resource-Friendly Video Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://printer-issues.techidaily.com/installation-manual-hp-smartoffice-800-series/"><u>Installation Manual: HP SmartOffice 800 Series</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/in-2024-highlighted-top-5-minimalist-action-camera-picks/"><u>In 2024, Highlighted Top 5 Minimalist Action Camera Picks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-tiktok-app-not-loading-on-chrome-troubleshoot-now/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  TikTok App Not Loading on Chrome?

Here are five benefits of using Auto HDR on your iPhone</p><ul><li>You can avoid editing your photos in post-processing, which saves time and reduces the risk of errors;</li><li>Auto HDR applies different levels of saturation and contrast depending on what you’re photographing, giving you more accurate colors;</li><li>It uses face detection to properly expose portraits; -</li><li>It improves details in low light situations; and</li><li>It’s enabled by default in iOS 11 so you don’t have to do anything.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/what-are-auto-hdr-smart-hdr-3-and-4-shooting-modes-5.jpg"                      alt="auto hdr"                ></p><h2 id="Should-you-Lookout-for-the-HDR-feature-on-iPhone-14"><a href="#Should-you-Lookout-for-the-HDR-feature-on-iPhone-14" class="headerlink" title="Should you Lookout for the HDR feature on iPhone 14?"></a>Should you Lookout for the HDR feature on iPhone 14?</h2><p>The rumor mill is generating leaks about a possible new 48 MP main sensor for the next-generation iPhone 14 Pro camera. Some features of this camera may include more-realistic colors and better low-light performance in addition to all of the other specs we have been hearing about recently.</p><p>If these rumors prove true, it’s possible that Apple will introduce an even more robust and efficient HDR system than what we see on iPhones today.</p><ul><li>iPhone 14 camera will come with a 48 Megapixel sensor. It is rumored that there would be more-realistic colors and better low light performance too.</li><li>8K video recording is a simple resolution bump for the Pro models. For example, if you record a 4K video at 30 frames per second (fps), then your videos playback at 15 fps when played back on an iPhone.</li><li>The selfie cameras of the iPhone 14 models will also receive a major upgrade. The new front-facing sensors are said to offer three times as many pixels. These pixels should help keep faces from looking distorted or pixilated while maintaining natural skin tones.</li></ul><h2 id="Final-words"><a href="#Final-words" class="headerlink" title="Final words"></a>Final words</h2><p>Computational photography is a technique that takes advantage of the impressive processing power of modern smartphones to create stunning and persuasive pictures. The most common examples of this are the Auto HDR and Smart HDR modes found on many iPhones.</p><p>These modes use computational photography to automatically improve the dynamic range and color of your photos, making them look much better than they would with traditional camera techniques.</p><p>Auto HDR will make sure both shadows and highlights are in focus, while Smart HDR 3 or 4 take it one step further by creating a high-dynamic-range image from three or four exposures.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>What is the HDR Feature for iPhone Photos?</p><p>HDR is a feature that allows you to take better photos in low-light situations and at night.

Here are five benefits of using Auto HDR on your iPhone</p><ul><li>You can avoid editing your photos in post-processing, which saves time and reduces the risk of errors;</li><li>Auto HDR applies different levels of saturation and contrast depending on what you’re photographing, giving you more accurate colors;</li><li>It uses face detection to properly expose portraits; -</li><li>It improves details in low light situations; and</li><li>It’s enabled by default in iOS 11 so you don’t have to do anything.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/what-are-auto-hdr-smart-hdr-3-and-4-shooting-modes-5.jpg"                      alt="auto hdr"                ></p><h2 id="Should-you-Lookout-for-the-HDR-feature-on-iPhone-14-1"><a href="#Should-you-Lookout-for-the-HDR-feature-on-iPhone-14-1" class="headerlink" title="Should you Lookout for the HDR feature on iPhone 14?"></a>Should you Lookout for the HDR feature on iPhone 14?</h2><p>The rumor mill is generating leaks about a possible new 48 MP main sensor for the next-generation iPhone 14 Pro camera. Some features of this camera may include more-realistic colors and better low-light performance in addition to all of the other specs we have been hearing about recently.</p><p>If these rumors prove true, it’s possible that Apple will introduce an even more robust and efficient HDR system than what we see on iPhones today.</p><ul><li>iPhone 14 camera will come with a 48 Megapixel sensor. It is rumored that there would be more-realistic colors and better low light performance too.</li><li>8K video recording is a simple resolution bump for the Pro models. For example, if you record a 4K video at 30 frames per second (fps), then your videos playback at 15 fps when played back on an iPhone.</li><li>The selfie cameras of the iPhone 14 models will also receive a major upgrade. The new front-facing sensors are said to offer three times as many pixels. These pixels should help keep faces from looking distorted or pixilated while maintaining natural skin tones.</li></ul><h2 id="Final-words-1"><a href="#Final-words-1" class="headerlink" title="Final words"></a>Final words</h2><p>Computational photography is a technique that takes advantage of the impressive processing power of modern smartphones to create stunning and persuasive pictures. The most common examples of this are the Auto HDR and Smart HDR modes found on many iPhones.</p><p>These modes use computational photography to automatically improve the dynamic range and color of your photos, making them look much better than they would with traditional camera techniques.</p><p>Auto HDR will make sure both shadows and highlights are in focus, while Smart HDR 3 or 4 take it one step further by creating a high-dynamic-range image from three or four exposures.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i

What factors should you take into consideration? And what are some of the common mistakes made by podcasters when it comes to naming their shows? So let’s dive into it.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Avoid-using-any-names-trademarked-copyrighted-or-already-in-use-by-another-show"><a href="#Tip-1-Avoid-using-any-names-trademarked-copyrighted-or-already-in-use-by-another-show" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1.

Avoid using any names trademarked, copyrighted, or already in use by another show</h3><p>The main legal principles with podcasts are copyright, publicity rights, and trademark. Therefore, Avoiding using any trademarked, copyrighted, or already used by another company or podcast is crucial.</p><p>Searching Google for trademarks is the best way to discover whether your name idea has already been trademarked. Moreover, you can check for conflicts by applying for podcast name approval via the Apple Podcasts Connect portal. If you’re unsure what you want, research similar names before settling.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Make-sure-the-name-has-not-been-used-before-on-Apple-Podcasts-and-Spotify"><a href="#Tip-2-Make-sure-the-name-has-not-been-used-before-on-Apple-Podcasts-and-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2.

Make sure the name has not been used before on Apple Podcasts and Spotify</h3><p>It is easy to search for your show’s potential name in a podcast directory. However, if the same name is already used, it is time to create a variation or start over.</p><p>You cannot submit your podcast to Spotify if there is a show with the same title.

Avoid overly long podcast names or “keyword stuffing,” as iTunes&#x2F;Apple Podcasts are clamping down on this.</p><p>When the audience comes and visits your channel, the name of it matters the most as it’s the most obvious thing that meets the eyes. In this case, you must create a channel name that is true to your content and catchy so it hooks the audience from the start.</p><h3 id="Tip-4-Try-to-say-your-podcast’s-name-out-loud-and-a-lot"><a href="#Tip-4-Try-to-say-your-podcast’s-name-out-loud-and-a-lot" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4.

You should also be able to recognize your podcast name if you hear it in passing, and it should be easy to pronounce. You can practice saying your podcast name by completing the following sentences:</p><ul><li>“Hi, I’m the host of ___________.”</li><li>“Welcome to another episode of ___________.”</li><li>“You’ve got to listen to ___________!”</li></ul><p>Choose a name you like to say because you’ll be saying it.

Can 2 podcasts have the same name?"></a>1. Can 2 podcasts have the same name?</h3><p>The simple answer would be <strong>“No.”</strong> You cannot have a podcast whose name is similar to another. It becomes an issue of legality and ethicality. If you create a channel with a name similar to another podcast, the original podcast channel will have a right to sue your channel.</p><p>In some rare cases, there have been podcasts with similar names, but usually, one of them will eventually go down.

Unfortunately, it is common in the industry as people tend to prey on the weak ones. But you can protect your channel by creating a podcast name that is unique in itself.</p><p>If you find accounts that pretend to be your channel, you can ask your audience to report such sources. Or the best course is legal action. But first, develop a trademark policy to help you give immunity against these channels.</p><p>So if in the future it gets to mislead your audience, they will be held accountable for legal action.</p><h3 id="4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast"><a href="#4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast" class="headerlink" title="4.

What factors should you take into consideration? And what are some of the common mistakes made by podcasters when it comes to naming their shows? So let’s dive into it.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Avoid-using-any-names-trademarked-copyrighted-or-already-in-use-by-another-show-1"><a href="#Tip-1-Avoid-using-any-names-trademarked-copyrighted-or-already-in-use-by-another-show-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1. Avoid using any names trademarked, copyrighted, or already in use by another show"></a>Tip 1. Avoid using any names trademarked, copyrighted, or already in use by another show</h3><p>The main legal principles with podcasts are copyright, publicity rights, and trademark. Therefore, Avoiding using any trademarked, copyrighted, or already used by another company or podcast is crucial.</p><p>Searching Google for trademarks is the best way to discover whether your name idea has already been trademarked. Moreover, you can check for conflicts by applying for podcast name approval via the Apple Podcasts Connect portal. If you’re unsure what you want, research similar names before settling.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Make-sure-the-name-has-not-been-used-before-on-Apple-Podcasts-and-Spotify-1"><a href="#Tip-2-Make-sure-the-name-has-not-been-used-before-on-Apple-Podcasts-and-Spotify-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2.

Make sure the name has not been used before on Apple Podcasts and Spotify</h3><p>It is easy to search for your show’s potential name in a podcast directory. However, if the same name is already used, it is time to create a variation or start over.</p><p>You cannot submit your podcast to Spotify if there is a show with the same title. Doing your research will save you time and hassle.</p><h3 id="Tip-3-iTunes-Apple-Podcasts-Keywords-“Spam-”-1"><a href="#Tip-3-iTunes-Apple-Podcasts-Keywords-“Spam-”-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3. iTunes &#x2F; Apple Podcasts &amp; Keywords “Spam.”"></a>Tip 3. iTunes &#x2F; Apple Podcasts &amp; Keywords “Spam.”</h3><p>Another goal in boosting or promoting your channel would be to make a channel name that is simple and easy to pronounce. Avoid overly long podcast names or “keyword stuffing,” as iTunes&#x2F;Apple Podcasts are clamping down on this.</p><p>When the audience comes and visits your channel, the name of it matters the most as it’s the most obvious thing that meets the eyes. In this case, you must create a channel name that is true to your content and catchy so it hooks the audience from the start.</p><h3 id="Tip-4-Try-to-say-your-podcast’s-name-out-loud-and-a-lot-1"><a href="#Tip-4-Try-to-say-your-podcast’s-name-out-loud-and-a-lot-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4. Try to say your podcast’s name out loud and a lot"></a>Tip 4. Try to say your podcast’s name out loud and a lot</h3><p>As a podcast is an audio medium, your name should be easy to pronounce. You should also be able to recognize your podcast name if you hear it in passing, and it should be easy to pronounce. You can practice saying your podcast name by completing the following sentences:</p><ul><li>“Hi, I’m the host of ___________.”</li><li>“Welcome to another episode of ___________.”</li><li>“You’ve got to listen to ___________!”</li></ul><p>Choose a name you like to say because you’ll be saying it.

Get feedback from your network</h3><p>Generating a name for a podcast is not an easy job. However, you can also get feedback from your network. For example, you are gathering suggestions from your friends or teammates. If your podcast has already got some followers, you can ask the audience for advice and let them comment below the podcast.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-Podcast-Name-Ideas-Generators-1"><a href="#Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-Podcast-Name-Ideas-Generators-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Can 2 podcasts have the same name?"></a>1. Can 2 podcasts have the same name?</h3><p>The simple answer would be <strong>“No.”</strong> You cannot have a podcast whose name is similar to another. It becomes an issue of legality and ethicality. If you create a channel with a name similar to another podcast, the original podcast channel will have a right to sue your channel.</p><p>In some rare cases, there have been podcasts with similar names, but usually, one of them will eventually go down. It is all about originality.</p><h3 id="2-Should-I-name-my-podcast-my-name-1"><a href="#2-Should-I-name-my-podcast-my-name-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Should I name my podcast my name?"></a>2. Should I name my podcast my name?</h3><p>There’s nothing wrong with naming your podcast with your name as long as it is unique and stands out. You cannot simply name your podcast, i.e., “<strong>Joe Rogan</strong>.” Instead, your podcast can include your name creatively, such as, i.e., <strong>“The Joe Rogan Experience.”</strong></p><h3 id="3-Can-someone-steal-my-podcast-name-1"><a href="#3-Can-someone-steal-my-podcast-name-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

Unfortunately, it is common in the industry as people tend to prey on the weak ones. But you can protect your channel by creating a podcast name that is unique in itself.</p><p>If you find accounts that pretend to be your channel, you can ask your audience to report such sources. Or the best course is legal action. But first, develop a trademark policy to help you give immunity against these channels.</p><p>So if in the future it gets to mislead your audience, they will be held accountable for legal action.</p><h3 id="4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast-1"><a href="#4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

But as your audience grows, changing the channel’s name will only disturb your audience. They might think the original content creator was changed or the purpose of the show has been changed.</p><p>Keeping to your originality and creativity will set your channel in the light. Your goal should be to choose a Podcast name that is unique from the beginning and work on growing it to its</p><p>best potential.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-pros-best-top-8-tripods-excelling-at-4k-video-capture/"><u>[New] Pro's Best  Top 8 Tripods Excelling at 4K Video Capture</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/2024-approved-key-steps-for-an-optimal-chromebook-zooming-experience/"><u>2024 Approved  Key Steps for an Optimal Chromebook Zooming Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-vmiospluswindows-harmony-hub/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, VMiOS+Windows Harmony Hub</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-superior-select-five-4k-cameras/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Superior Select Five 4K Cameras</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-analyzing-the-impact-of-burst-on-live-action-shoots/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Analyzing the Impact of Burst on Live-Action Shoots</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-zero-shaking-zones-how-to-fix-unstable-gopro-videos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Zero Shaking Zones  How to Fix Unstable GoPro Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-drones-and-editing-synergy-top-9-software-compared/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Drones and Editing Synergy - Top 9 Software Compared</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-set-the-atmosphere-musical-statuses/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Set the Atmosphere  Musical Statuses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-editing-video.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-create-text-animation-for-videos/"><u>New 2024 Approved How to Create Text Animation for Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-optimizing.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-synergizing-individual-tracks-into-a-singular-polished-auditory-assembly/"><u>Updated In 2024, Synergizing Individual Tracks Into a Singular, Polished Auditory Assembly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-uav-technology-unveiled-the-yuneec-4k-journey/"><u>2024 Approved  UAV Technology Unveiled  The Yuneec 4K Journey</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/in-2024-zooms-finest-audio-to-text-solutions-complimentary-and-subscriptions/"><u>In 2024, Zoom's Finest Audio-to-Text Solutions  Complimentary & Subscriptions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/in-2024-iphone-lens-exploration-key-angles-to-elevate-your-photo-game/"><u>In 2024, IPhone Lens Exploration  Key Angles to Elevate Your Photo Game</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/ultimate-iphone-video-editor-comparison-cameo-or-filmorago/"><u>Ultimate iPhone Video Editor Comparison  Cameo or FilmoraGo</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-unleash-your-creative-brand-selecting-one-of-a-kind-channel-titles/"><u>[Updated] Unleash Your Creative Brand  Selecting One-of-a-Kind Channel Titles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-beginners-guide-to-mesmerizing-bokeh-in-instagram-stories/"><u>In 2024, The Beginner’s Guide to Mesmerizing Bokeh in Instagram Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-synchronizing-audio-with-visual-media-the-quicktime-method/"><u>Updated In 2024, Synchronizing Audio with Visual Media The QuickTime Method</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The resources utilized to express a story and convey a message include films, photography, animation, and music. These stories may distribute more widely and swiftly than ever through online platforms like webpages, journals, and social media sharing sites.</p><p><strong><em>“Simply put, it is telling stories with digital technologies. Digital stories are narratives built from the stuff of cyberculture.”</em></strong> <a class="link"   href="https://www.ala.org/acrl/publications/keeping%5Fup%5Fwith/storytelling#:~:text=It%20involves%20creating%20and%20sharing,telling%20stories%20with%20digital%20technologies." >-Bryan Alexander. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Additionally, digital storytelling can include a variety of digital narratives. A rising number of businesses are taking note and investigating the potential applications of a digital story.

Development of Digital Storytelling"></a>Part II. Development of Digital Storytelling</h2><p>Dana Atchley and Joe Lambert of the Center for Digital Storytelling started the digital storytelling advancement in 1994 by teaching others how to create digital stories. Although the power of storytelling has existed for thousands of years, it has only recently become possible for storytellers to <strong>“become digital”</strong> because of the advancement of personal computers and friendly modern communications.</p><p>High goals and outdated technologies coexisted throughout this period. Browsers were quite straightforward at the time, and dial-up remained still in use. There were no devices for accessing the internet, and most individuals read the digital narrative on their desktop computers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/tools-and-tips-virtual-storytelling-2.jpg"                      alt="tools and tips for virtual storytelling"                ></p><p>In this regard, the Center for Digital Storytelling developed a digital story that emphasized first-person narratives that framed memories as potent stories using visuals, audio, and music.

Images, visual effects, and soundtracks are not merely additions to the story; they are crucial and inseparable components. As a result, digital storytelling demands variety, multisensory stimulation, and a variety of media channels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/online-modern-storytelling-view-3.jpg"                      alt="online view of modern storytelling"                ></p><p>While oral and written stories in traditional storytelling will only focus on listening and reading abilities, digital storytelling will emphasize other skills like interaction by encouraging knowledge acquisition and technology literacy by interacting with technological sources, thus possessing the power of storytelling.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> Visit <a href="https://youtu.be/eryg29f294U"><strong>Wondershare Filmora9: Discover the Power of Storytelling</strong></a> if you’re interested in learning how to create a digital storytelling video example.</p><h2 id="Part-III-Practices-of-Digital-Storytelling"><a href="#Part-III-Practices-of-Digital-Storytelling" class="headerlink" title="Part III.

But, from a wide plethora of choices available on the internet to download for video editing, you could be confused regarding which one would be the best for you. That is why here in this article, we will talk about <strong>final-cut pro-plug-ins</strong> that can be downloaded from the internet free of cost or by paying.</p><p>If you are not aware of what plug-ins for final cut pro are. Then, let us take a brief look at them: - Third-party add-ons, called plug-ins, are tools used to enhance videos in final cut pro X. They can add new features to your final cut pro software that original developers didn’t include. Most plug-ins are created by ordinary people to enhance their work and are sometimes shared on the internet for free or at a fee.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Fx factory pro</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">mLUT</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Color Finale 2.0</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">NewBlueFX</a></li><li><a href="#part1-5">Movie Pop</a></li><li><a href="#part1-6">Free XEffects Matrix Plugin</a></li><li><a href="#part1-7">Motion blur plug-in</a></li><li><a href="#part1-8">Free data pop</a></li><li><a href="#part1-9">Distortion effects</a></li><li><a href="#part1-10">Shutter shock FCPX plug-in</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">Part 2.

Fx factory pro</h3><p>Fx factory pro is one of the <strong>best final cut pro plug ins</strong> that users can try for free to access if the plug-in is suited to their video editing work. But while using the trials, fx factory pro would watermark the video, although, after purchase, it gets removed. Users can easily download it from the Fx factory website, and its smooth layout will help you quickly navigate its homepage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/fx-factory-pro.jpg"                      alt="fx factory pro"                ></p><p>If you are thinking about fx factory pro integration with <strong>fcpx plug-ins</strong>, you need not worry about that because the coordination between the two is off-charts. Many professionals looking for video editing websites consider Fx factory as their ideal destination for choosing plug-ins for their work.</p><h3 id="2-mLUT"><a href="#2-mLUT" class="headerlink" title="2. mLUT"></a>2. mLUT</h3><p>Are you not satisfied with final cut pro X color grading software even though you don’t necessarily hate it but want to see improvements in it? That’s where the mLUT plug-in of motion VFX comes into the picture. Ideally, it is a free plug-in that video editors can use to look up their tables in one place together. One of the eye-catching features of mLUT from Motion VFX would ask your video to be shot in a longer format to get the best out of your color grading capabilities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/mlut-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="mlut plug in"                ></p><p>If you want to add more to your video editing, the paid version of mLUT packs offered by Motion VFX will allow you to add a cinematic look to your video efficiently. After all this, you find your video or image not perfect, so make sure you keep using it.</p><h3 id="3-Color-Finale-2-0"><a href="#3-Color-Finale-2-0" class="headerlink" title="3. Color Finale 2.0"></a>3. Color Finale 2.0</h3><p>Most people using final cut pro X were somewhat unsatisfied with the internally practical fast color correction tools. It was always about having something that properly allowed video color grading workflow. That is when color finale 2.0, a newer version of the initially released color finale, is known to come in handy. It is a new and more improved version of the previous one, which is optimized for having metal and more color management features such as ACES.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/color-finale-2-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="color finale 2 plug in"                ></p><p>From the beginning, the color finale was designed as a plug-in for the final cut pro-X. It offers the users two options: go for the standard one or pro to enjoy more features like tangent panel control, group grading, ACES color space, film grain simulation, and mask tracking.</p><h3 id="4-NewBlueFX"><a href="#4-NewBlueFX" class="headerlink" title="4. NewBlueFX"></a>4. NewBlueFX</h3><p>Suppose you are looking for a compatible video editing program like adobe after effects, premiere pro, and some other software like it. Then, a new blue FX that provides an alternative to critical aspects like framing, masking, and offering necessary plug-ins to improve the videos and eliminate other challenges could be the choice for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/new-blue-fx-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="new blue fx plug in"                ></p><p>There are many plug-ins offered in New blue fx, and each has features that push forward for its improvement every day. The zoom effects or auto-pan plug-in could be your solution when adding some still motion or picture into your video. It identifies the significant highs and lows of the video or image, changes the detail, and contrasts automatically whenever or wherever needed.</p><h3 id="5-Movie-Pop"><a href="#5-Movie-Pop" class="headerlink" title="5. Movie Pop"></a>5. Movie Pop</h3><p>Do you consider you’re a crazy fan of movies, and being a video creator, you are always on the move on how to recreate those famous movie sequences that you watched in movie halls or on your computer? Then, the movie could be the perfect plug-in, ideally serving this kind of situation. It is considered the easiest to recreate those title sequences of the favorite movies you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/movie-pop-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="movie pop plug in"                ></p><p>If you want something more out of these <strong>final cut plug</strong>-<strong>ins</strong>, add your recreation of the title. Then, unfortunately, it won’t be able to offer you those because movie pop developed by stupid raisins was made for the above work only and nothing more. It is a free plug-in that editors can download from the internet.</p><h3 id="6-Free-XEffects-Matrix-Plugin"><a href="#6-Free-XEffects-Matrix-Plugin" class="headerlink" title="6.

The process is also quite simple:</p><ul><li>Entering the main title text</li><li>Adjusting the color density according to your specification</li><li>The text’s speed and ideal position</li></ul><p>After completing these above steps, your plug-in will be built automatically.</p><h3 id="7-Motion-blur-plug-in"><a href="#7-Motion-blur-plug-in" class="headerlink" title="7.
