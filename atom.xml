However, when we talk about Virtual Reality Resolutions, it can be somewhat a little confusing. There are some VR headsets that can be used in one screen that outputs 2 images while the others have 2 screens.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c17xsnbinCQ?si=xHKslFgC3QbxY4qW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Perfect-Resolution-for-VR-8K-per-Eye"><a href="#Perfect-Resolution-for-VR-8K-per-Eye" class="headerlink" title="Perfect Resolution for VR: 8K per Eye"></a>Perfect Resolution for VR: 8K per Eye</h3><p> Compare to bigger televisions sets we have today, along with a screen that is only inches from the face of the viewer, any extra pixels create a huge different to the whole quality of the image and offers immersive effect. However, what most people do not realize that more pixel will cause the fewer problem in the long run.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q4-YQ9Wjtfg?si=6afn1fydg_Wb9B8z" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="More-pixels-fewer-problems"><a href="#More-pixels-fewer-problems" class="headerlink" title="More pixels, fewer problems"></a>More pixels, fewer problems</h3><p> According to Luckey, taking care and doing improvement on the current resolution of the Rift is the main area of focus. He added that each time they throw more amount of pixels on it, the more it will create a difference. On the other hand, according to the Oculus VP of Product Nate Mitchell, the last and final consumer version of the product will be as good as the HD prototype after it sees the release.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qmQjRcnaq9g?si=jadcGtXemUAlKOTa" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Latency-and-Position"><a href="#Latency-and-Position" class="headerlink" title="Latency and Position"></a>Latency and Position</h3><p> Latency is another major problem for delivering optimum and realistic VR. The time between the things moving your head and seeing the appropriate view for the angle is the key if you want to make a realistic space. However, this is far from reality. Mitchell and Luckey claimed that they can get their hardware below the threshold for the perception of human, devoid of any astronomical cost. Plus, the hardware will team all the latency out of their end of their pipeline.</p><p> The main reason here is that the hardware is just part of the latency equation, and even when the image lag that was introduced by the Rift is the 1 or 2 milliseconds that was imposed by the USB transfer cable, the engine of the game has to keep up along with that degree of performance.</p><p> Aside from that, maintaining the latency low is a key whenever executing plans for the positional tracking – maintaining the track of the position of the user the head moves forward and backward or side to side than just roaming in place. This is said to be the most crucial part, which needs to be added to the virtual reality experience.</p><p> So, typically, higher resolutions are at all times better. The only thing here is that you need to worry about the limitations, which the panels brings but as well as the added price. According to Michael Abrash from Oculus, he claimed that 16k per eye-filling that is filled with 180 of view is forthcoming retinal resolution, however then again the eyes of a human are a just high resolution in the center and quite blurred elsewhere. But the resolution alone is not good enough to Virtual Reality as the brains take in data coming from masses of other sensory and visual cues in order to accept experiences as 100% real.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OZQJUTr44rA?si=ADA0nD1VnXjR_sH0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-extract-and-save-still-images-from-movies-in-windows-photos-for-2024/"><u>[New] Extract and Save Still Images From Movies in Windows Photos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-a-closer-examination-of-googles-ar-stickers-and-competitors/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved A Closer Examination of Google's AR Stickers and Competitors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-elevating-listeners-interest-writing-podcast-summaries/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Elevating Listeners' Interest Writing Podcast Summaries</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-essential-skills-for-podcast-description-writers/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Essential Skills for Podcast Description Writers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-join-anytime-easy-zoom-integration-with-android-devices/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Join Anytime Easy Zoom Integration with Android Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-guide-to-scouting-for-best-free-srt-translation-tools/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Guide to Scouting for Best Free SRT Translation Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/2023s-most-popular-online-video-hub-on-facebook-for-2024/"><u>2023'S Most Popular Online Video Hub on Facebook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-explore-androids-creative-collage-software-haven/"><u>2024 Approved Explore Android’s Creative Collage Software Haven</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/best-free-design-resources-in-after-effects-land-for-2024/"><u>Best Free Design Resources in After Effects Land for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/funds-flowchart-from-sung-rhythms-to-visual-harmony-for-2024/"><u>Funds Flowchart From Sung Rhythms To Visual Harmony for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-downgrade-iphone-12-to-the-previous-iosipados-version-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How to Downgrade iPhone 12 to the Previous iOS/iPadOS Version? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-magnificent-art-of-pokemon-go-streaming-on-oppo-f25-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, The Magnificent Art of Pokemon Go Streaming On Oppo F25 Pro 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-collection-of-10-advanced-fcp-tools/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Collection of 10 Advanced FCP Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-videos.techidaily.com/solutions-to-clear-up-fuzzy-videos-for-mobile-users/"><u>Solutions to Clear Up Fuzzy Videos for Mobile Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/step-by-step-solutions-for-fixing-talk-feature-problems-in-overwatch/"><u>Step-by-Step Solutions for Fixing Talk Feature Problems in Overwatch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/veelvulpenreusse-vlac-to-m4r-konvertor-gebruik-onbruikbare-gratis-online-tool/"><u>Veelvulpenreusse VLAC-to-M4R Konvertor: Gebruik Onbruikbare Gratis Online Tool!</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

How can you promote it the best way?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/make-a-live-stream.jpg"                      alt="make a live stream"                ></p><p>There are many different things to keep in mind and in this article, we will talk about every single one so you can get started creating successful live streams. There’s no problem with admitting that the technical side of live streaming is pretty complex and a little harder to understand, but with the right guide, you’ll get there!</p><p>Now you know the basics, let’s get started!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DBMTAJBx-X4?si=sje5pFJXiHzJJGbP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-What-camera-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-1-What-camera-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What camera do you need?"></a>Part 1. What camera do you need?</h2><p>When you’re just starting out, you can live stream from your phone or laptop’s camera, there are also good webcams available for not a lot of money. If you do have a budget a high-end camera, for example around $2000, you can invest in the following cameras:</p><p>Panasonic GH5<br>Sony A7 II<br>Panasonic LUMIX GH4</p><p>A camcorder or webcam will work perfectly for live streaming as long as the camera able to shoot at a minimum of 720p HD, 24fps. It’s totally fine to start off with the webcam on your laptop, or a better webcam. I have used the Logitech C922 for streaming and it works like a charm. The Mevo Plus helps you on great quality when you use a mobile device. After that you run your program into a software such as OBS where you can apply filters to improve your image, which you will be using to also live stream onto the actual platform such as YouTube or Twitch. A plus is that you don’t need a memory card for streaming as you’re not recording on the camera itself.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-microphone-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-2-What-microphone-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What microphone do you need?"></a>Part 2. What microphone do you need?</h2><p>When talking about audio, it’s one of the most important elements of your overall live stream. If people are getting frustrated trying to hear what you say, they are less likely to stay. Nowadays a lot of smartphones have amazing microphones with built-in noise cancellation and echo reduction. If you’re using a laptop or desktop, we recommend an external microphone as the webcam microphones aren’t that great.</p><p>USB microphones are the best choice for at-home streaming. Fanatics will rather use XLR microphones because of its sound quality. Good XLR microphones are a lot of the times way more expensive than regular USB microphones. XLRs also need an external sound card&#x2F;audio interface to be powered to your computer, like the Focusrite Scarlett Solo, starting at around $130.</p><p>Budget microphones give you great streaming quality. The only downside is that they lack certain features like a mute button and voltage&#x2F;gain controls, which forces you to find another solution to make up for that such as using plugins in your streaming software to give more gain to your microphone and or use hotkeys to mute.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-streaming-software-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-3-What-streaming-software-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. What streaming software do you need?"></a>Part 3. What streaming software do you need?</h2><p>The software you’ll be using to stream isn’t built into Windows, Mac, or any other operating systems by default. You first need to download a third-party streaming software.</p><p><strong>OBS</strong></p><p>OBS Studio is open-source software used for recording and streaming. It is free to download and use but misses some of the more advanced options that you see in paid programs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="obs studio"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/grbt-5VvbuI?si=qnoirlmljslpqcQj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>If you are prepared to devote time to learning its functionality, OBS Studio has a lot more strength than most of the other free software, that’s why it is so popular under content creators. You will also find other plugins that people have created to add to OBS Studio’s functionality and flexibility to enhance your recording or streaming experience.</p><p><strong>Streamlabs</strong></p><p>Streamlabs was originally a live streaming tool that streamers use with other live streaming software together. Streamlabs OBS now combines the Streamlabs tool with OBS Studio, giving you a more in-depth streaming program with a more organized user interface. Just like OBS Studio, Streamlabs OBS is free to download and use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/streamlabs-desktop.jpg"                      alt="streamlabs"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpdGEJJwMLY?si=eKgXOPpNeYvYKcel" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Nvidia ShadowPlay</strong></p><p>Nvidia ShadowPlay is designed for gamers and comes combined with Nvidia GeForce graphics cards. It allows people to stream high-quality livestreams and videos. It’s suitable for platforms such as Facebook Live, YouTube and Twitch.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-record.jpg"                      alt="nivdia shadowplay"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uV3vm805eX0?si=YSPcsFxBcJmoxLsU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>ShadowPlay’s DVR-style Instant Replay mode can be used by pressing a hotkey to save the last 30 seconds of your content to your hard drive or share to Twitch or YouTube. You can manually record videos for as long as you like because ShadowPlay is hardware accelerated. You can make up to a 15-second GIFs from your ShadowPlay video to ceate highlights, edit them afterwards with color grading effects, adding music, text, and upload it to Facebook, YouTube or Vimeo.</p><p><strong>XSplit Broadcaster</strong></p><p>XSplit Broadcaster is a recording and linve software for Windows. XSplit allows you to record and stream in 4K 60fps. You can use XSplit Broadcaster to stream on all platforms you can imagine that have a live function, you can even go live on multiple stream services at the same time. The streaming software has a lot of stream management features. There’s an option to edit scenes before starting your live stream with the Scene Preview Editor.</p><p>The ability to creative your own title and tags for ease of search is outstanding. The list of compatible technology that integrates with the software and the amount of data servers there are to help accommodate your needs while streaming, no matter if you are using ethernet or WiFi, XSplit is super easy to use for gaming, recording or podcasting.</p><p><strong>Wirecast</strong></p><p>What’s cool is that you can live stream from unlimited amount of sources. Microphones, cameras, IP cameras, and more. A built-in web-browser is able to show things such as web pages as well. You can mix up to 8 separate audio tracks and add processing combined with effects to enhance the viewer experience even more. Its powerful production capabilities make it super easy to switch back and forth between different live camera feeds while mixing in prerecorded video, graphics, audio, transitions and even slides.</p><p>Wirecast enables event organizers to comine live or pre-recorded video together with audio to achieve professional results as well as individual audio tracks for separate outputs. This program comes with a stock media library with videos, background images, music and more. Wirecast lets you stream like a pro and with its high-end features. This streaming software has multi-level audio recording, and 1-17 slot multi-viewer output for more advanced level of streaming and even ISO record assistance.</p><p><strong>VidBlasterX</strong></p><p>This is one of the high-end software systems with a built-in switcher and audio mixer. You can combine any number of floating input or output modules that can be positioned anywhere you want in the user interface. The modules can be docked to other ones to create the studio design that works best for you. It’s a huge benefit for having the most customization of all the 3rd party encoder apps you can use for live streaming.</p><p>The Home &amp; Studio editions comes with community support; the Broadcast edition comes with both priority and community support as well. The VidBlasterX Trial Edition is the same as the Studio Edition, with a watermark added to all output channels. The VidblasterX website tells: “VidBlasterX is a versatile and powerful ultra-low latency cascading vision mixer and video router with built-in scalers, time base correctors, frame synchronisers, IP video encoders and decoders, video players, recorders, keyers, effects and much more.”</p><p><strong>vMix</strong></p><p>This program also allows you to create professional quality videos and live shows. vMix offers you the power to add multiple cameras angles, images, videos, audio, titles, Powerpoint presentations, chroma key, virtual sets and even more than that. You are then able to showcase, live stream and record your content all at the same time. vMix integrates with EasyWorship, Flowplayer, Facebook, Restream, Vimeo, Twitch and YouTube.</p><p>That being said, vMix has excelled in great features and looks to be coming out with even more every six months. This program has added everything you need. Their integration of dedicated Call-In features together with NDI &amp; SRT support is clearly included and is available at a very affordable price. After all, we definitely recommend anyone wanting to move from a hardware solution to this kind of a software, to give vMix a try. Especially when they offer you a full 60-day Free Trial and it’s not a limited trial version either, but rather the whole top end version that includes everything you need to boost your live streaming career off the ground!</p><p><strong>Ffmpeg</strong></p><p>When talking about Ffmpeg, we’d like to mention that this is a very basic broadcasting software compatible with Dacast’s streaming platform. From what we noticed is that Ffmpeg is very easy and quick to learn where you won’t need to open another application in order to use it. As long as you’re happy with using the command line, you can use it for video and audio conversions, compression, and many other tools included in the options. We did use it to try at video editing, after using other paid software too, like VEGAS Pro. We do agree that it’s a matter of getting used to the program. You can find anything you need online to get started, or when you are lost. It’s good that it does not claim a lot of space on the hard drive. This is a complete new way of live streaming and video editing.</p><p><strong>Restream.io</strong></p><p>You likely have heard about this program. Restream is a complete and professional live streaming application for anyone who wants to start their online career professionally.

The background color is black and hence, the focus is on the text and its surrounding visible objects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/2d-geometric-intro-template.jpg"                      alt="2d geometric intro template"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HSFNIAYChbA?si=4TIlsUrYmY5vP2il" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="7-Blue-and-Rainy-Intro-Template-1"><a href="#7-Blue-and-Rainy-Intro-Template-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Blue and Rainy Intro Template"></a>7. Blue and Rainy Intro Template</h3><p>The base theme of the template is blue and the background is cloudy and rainy. But there is a host of animations and effects put together. There is a touch of black and white and a colourful effect. You can accommodate your logo and title together.</p><p>The template shows characters one by one and joins them to form the title. The background and the text are both 3D in texture. The template also has a 2D version that you can use on your video if you are tired of 3D texts and titles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/blue-and-rainy-intro-template.jpg"                      alt="blue and rainy intro template"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aqeO4ed766s?si=AWtKHxP4hvQRd_lk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="8-3D-Cool-Gold-Intro-1"><a href="#8-3D-Cool-Gold-Intro-1" class="headerlink" title="8. 3D Cool Gold Intro"></a>8. 3D Cool Gold Intro</h3><p>There is a craze for gold effects in texts and titles. This is another 3D text-based template but the text effect truly stands out. It is definitely a majestic effect that is a treat to the eyes. Thereafter, there are spins of the entire title as well as the individual characters.</p><p>The overall frame animation adds to the animation immensely. The background is dark but colorful that matches well with the text effect. This is enhancing the overall text effect thanks to the dynamic movement of the elements.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/3d-cool-gold-intro.jpg"                      alt="3d cool gold intro"                ></p><h3 id="9-Free-Storm-Intro-Template-1"><a href="#9-Free-Storm-Intro-Template-1" class="headerlink" title="9. Free Storm Intro Template"></a>9. Free Storm Intro Template</h3><p>There are certain intro templates you must have in your collection. The lightning and storm effect is one of the most demanding intro templates. The overall effect is somewhat dark but that is what you expect in a stormy environment.</p><p>The characters of the titles have the stone texture in 3D mode. They have their individual spinning animation. The lightning effect on the title along with the stormy background is truly impactful. All you need to do is to set appropriate background music to enhance the animation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/free-storm-intro-template.jpg"                      alt="free storm intro template"                ></p><h3 id="10-Blue-Intro-1"><a href="#10-Blue-Intro-1" class="headerlink" title="10. Blue Intro"></a>10. Blue Intro</h3><p>If you prefer an outer space dynamic background with titles floating, this is exactly the same. The title floats in outer space in slow motion. Thereafter, it creates an impactful transition from slow to sudden shock motion. All the while the background has shooting stars that adds to the overall animation.</p><p>The title is in 3D texture. A graphical object in the shape of the planetary ring has been used for enhancing the effect. Along with those, there is the light dispersion and blurry effect that makes the text stand out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/dynamic-blue-intro-template.jpg"                      alt="dynamic blue intro template"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fHWdQw1gRyI?si=ve9wZnPupiooLThG" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Alternative-Way-to-Make-Intro-Video-1"><a href="#Part-2-Alternative-Way-to-Make-Intro-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Here, we’ve explained three methods that are not just reliable but also work for fixing export SRT from Premiere pro not working issue. Keep reading to find out more about these fixes.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Use-Export-Media-Option"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Export-Media-Option" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use Export Media Option"></a>Method 1: Use Export Media Option</h3><p>The “Export Media” option in Adobe Premiere Pro is effective for exporting SRT without problems. However, using this method means you’re exploring the .srt file with a video file. The process to use this method is outlined below;</p><p>Step1 Firstly, right-click on the SRT file from the Premiere pro software project panel. Then select ‘Export Media.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/fix-for-exporting-srt-file-from-premiere-1.jpg"                      alt="select export media"                ></p><p>Step2 Once you click on “Export Media” you’ll notice different options. Ignore the video export options (or tick off ‘video’ if you like), then navigate down to the “Captions tab”.</p><p>Step3 Click on “Create Sidecar File” under ‘Export Options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/fix-for-exporting-srt-file-from-premiere-2.jpg"                      alt="click on create sidecar file"                ></p><p>Step4 Finally, navigate to ‘File Format’ and select SubRip Subtitle Format (.srt). Then hit the “Export” button to complete the operation.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r_wWybMqZEM?si=0nPjCQDLS2MCaQbG" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-2-Export-SRT-as-Sidecar-File"><a href="#Method-2-Export-SRT-as-Sidecar-File" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Export SRT as Sidecar File"></a>Method 2: Export SRT as Sidecar File</h3><p>Another way to export SRT files from Adobe Premiere Pro is by exporting the file as a sidecar file. You might ask “What is a sidecar file?” A sidecar file refers to a computer file that stores data that is not supported by the format of its source file. The sidecar file from the source could be more than one, and it could contain meta databases.</p><p>Now let’s take a look at the step-by-step process to export SRT as a sidecar file.</p><p>Step1 Click on the “SRT File” from the Premiere Pro interface.</p><p>Step2 Navigate to “File” and select Exports, then choose “Captions”. By doing so, you’ll be able to export the SRT file.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Export-SRT-File-with-Timestamps"><a href="#Method-3-Export-SRT-File-with-Timestamps" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Export SRT File with Timestamps"></a>Method 3: Export SRT File with Timestamps</h3><p>The previously mentioned methods will allow you to export SRT either with video or as a sidecar file. But if you’re looking to export SRT file with timestamps, this method will work for you. The process is straightforward as the prior discussed methods.</p><p>Here is how the process works;</p><p>Step1 Firstly, select SEQUENCE in the project panel.</p><p>Step2 Up next, click File -&gt; Export -&gt; Captions. Once you complete that, you’ll export the SRT file as a sidecar file with timestamps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/fix-for-exporting-srt-file-from-premiere-3.jpg"                      alt="open export settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZma8PBO0D8?si=9-qQgGVTuChYd27a" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zWYVKFk3yPQ?si=Yu7xsjIYgRiq8zHk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Note:</strong> for this to work, the video must be on one video layer.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Easiest-Actionable-Fix-Edit-and-Export-SRT-Files-Only-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Easiest-Actionable-Fix-Edit-and-Export-SRT-Files-Only-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Easiest &amp; Actionable Fix: Edit and Export SRT Files Only with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 3: Easiest &amp; Actionable Fix: Edit and Export SRT Files Only with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>If Adobe Premiere Pro is still giving you issues with exporting SRT file from its interface, the best and easiest solution is to edit the SRT file on a powerful software like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Plus, it supports more advanced tools that facilitate faster and easier SRT editing and exporting.</p><p>Part 1: Why Does Premiere Pro Export SRT Subtitles Fail</p><p>There are several reasons why Premiere pro export SRT subtitles might fail. The common ones include;</p><p><strong>Wrong Element Selection in The Project Panel</strong></p><p>Yes, when you’re exporting SRT, if you fail to select the caption file before you use the relevant buttons for exportation, the “Export” option will be grayed out. Hence, preventing you from being able to export the SRT file.</p><p><strong>Improper settings selection</strong></p><p>If, unfortunately, you select the wrong settings for your file during the exportation of SRT, there’s a high chance that you’ll not be able to complete the export action successfully.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fix-Premiere-Pro-Export-SRT-Subtitles-Fail-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fix-Premiere-Pro-Export-SRT-Subtitles-Fail-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fix Premiere Pro Export SRT Subtitles Fail"></a>Part 2: How to Fix Premiere Pro Export SRT Subtitles Fail</h2><p>Fixing the Premiere pro export subtitles fail error is not a daunting task if you know the right tricks to execute the operation. Here, we’ve explained three methods that are not just reliable but also work for fixing export SRT from Premiere pro not working issue. Keep reading to find out more about these fixes.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Use-Export-Media-Option-1"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Export-Media-Option-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use Export Media Option"></a>Method 1: Use Export Media Option</h3><p>The “Export Media” option in Adobe Premiere Pro is effective for exporting SRT without problems. However, using this method means you’re exploring the .srt file with a video file. The process to use this method is outlined below;</p><p>Step1 Firstly, right-click on the SRT file from the Premiere pro software project panel. Then select ‘Export Media.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/fix-for-exporting-srt-file-from-premiere-1.jpg"                      alt="select export media"                ></p><p>Step2 Once you click on “Export Media” you’ll notice different options. Ignore the video export options (or tick off ‘video’ if you like), then navigate down to the “Captions tab”.</p><p>Step3 Click on “Create Sidecar File” under ‘Export Options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/fix-for-exporting-srt-file-from-premiere-2.jpg"                      alt="click on create sidecar file"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0pSRlspzW-A?si=A82G3Yxwj_31cKDq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step4 Finally, navigate to ‘File Format’ and select SubRip Subtitle Format (.srt).

You might ask “What is a sidecar file?” A sidecar file refers to a computer file that stores data that is not supported by the format of its source file. The sidecar file from the source could be more than one, and it could contain meta databases.</p><p>Now let’s take a look at the step-by-step process to export SRT as a sidecar file.</p><p>Step1 Click on the “SRT File” from the Premiere Pro interface.</p><p>Step2 Navigate to “File” and select Exports, then choose “Captions”. By doing so, you’ll be able to export the SRT file.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Export-SRT-File-with-Timestamps-1"><a href="#Method-3-Export-SRT-File-with-Timestamps-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Export SRT File with Timestamps"></a>Method 3: Export SRT File with Timestamps</h3><p>The previously mentioned methods will allow you to export SRT either with video or as a sidecar file. But if you’re looking to export SRT file with timestamps, this method will work for you. The process is straightforward as the prior discussed methods.</p><p>Here is how the process works;</p><p>Step1 Firstly, select SEQUENCE in the project panel.</p><p>Step2 Up next, click File -&gt; Export -&gt; Captions. Once you complete that, you’ll export the SRT file as a sidecar file with timestamps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/fix-for-exporting-srt-file-from-premiere-3.jpg"                      alt="open export settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> for this to work, the video must be on one video layer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xg3PHS_Ee80?si=fE_iGIqHjKvWFIN3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Easiest-Actionable-Fix-Edit-and-Export-SRT-Files-Only-with-Wondershare-Filmora-1"><a href="#Part-3-Easiest-Actionable-Fix-Edit-and-Export-SRT-Files-Only-with-Wondershare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Easiest &amp; Actionable Fix: Edit and Export SRT Files Only with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 3: Easiest &amp; Actionable Fix: Edit and Export SRT Files Only with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>If Adobe Premiere Pro is still giving you issues with exporting SRT file from its interface, the best and easiest solution is to edit the SRT file on a powerful software like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

It is entirely acoustic, with no visual elements. The dialogue, sound effects, and music help the audience understand what is going on. They shape the story by imagining the settings and characters.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hpne0zPsZwU?si=yN5QDsG_WLb_Y3u-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-Everything-about-Radio-Drama-Scripts"><a href="#Part-1-Everything-about-Radio-Drama-Scripts" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Everything about Radio Drama Scripts"></a>Part 1. Everything about Radio Drama Scripts</h2><p>A radio play script is written in a specific format that allows the playwright to convey how sound and music will be used in the performance. For example, one page of dialogue equals about one minute of airtime. Each scene should be labeled with a number. Normally, lines are double-spaced.</p><h3 id="1-What-are-radio-drama-scripts"><a href="#1-What-are-radio-drama-scripts" class="headerlink" title="1. What are radio drama scripts?"></a>1. What are radio drama scripts?</h3><p>A radio drama is a presentation of a fictional work distributed on the radio. It is completely acoustic with no visual components. The audience understands what is happening through dialogue, sound effects, and music. They give form to the story by visualizing the environment and characters.</p><p>Audio dramas can be works of fiction written expressly for radio broadcasting or podcasting. Alternatively, they can be adapted from plays, novels, short stories, etc.</p><p>Now there is often a need to write audio dramas specifically for radio, as stage plays rely on what the audience can see on stage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/radio-drama-scripts-1.jpg"                      alt="radio drama scripts"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3AGmFrtBLHw?si=VhvpUaXHPBHl6OT6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Elements-of-radio-drama"><a href="#2-Elements-of-radio-drama" class="headerlink" title="2. Elements of radio drama"></a>2. Elements of radio drama</h3><p>Drama’s elements are its fundamental building blocks. The elements of drama are defined as the “key ingredients” of drama in the Arts in New Zealand Curriculum.</p><p>Radio drama contains the same elements as stage drama:</p><ul><li><strong>Role:</strong> characters in the game</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> when the event takes place</li><li><strong>Place:</strong> where the action takes place</li><li><strong>Action:</strong> what happens in the drama?</li><li><strong>Tension:</strong> conflict between characters and their surroundings</li><li><strong>Focus:</strong> the thoughts, feelings, or characters the playwright wants us to focus on at a particular moment.</li></ul><p>In radio drama, however, the playwright must inform us of the elements through various means, because we cannot get the information with our eyes. Radio drama is essentially heard, not seen.</p><h3 id="3-Radio-drama-features"><a href="#3-Radio-drama-features" class="headerlink" title="3. Radio drama features"></a>3. Radio drama features</h3><p><strong>The following are Radio Drama Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Radio drama uses sound to convey ideas to the audience. Audio can be in the form of dialogue, sound effects, or music.</li><li>Actors can play more than one role from moment to moment because only the voice needs to be changed.</li><li>Actors only use voice to express a character. They don’t need to use action, gestures, or facial expressions because the audience can’t see them.</li><li>There is no need for blocking or stage business in radio drama. However, actors may need to plan their movement to and from the microphone.</li><li>Radio playback can be set almost anywhere. There are no physical limits to overcome. Settings can easily be created with music and sound effects.</li><li>Radio drama contains a lot of dialogue. Since we can’t see what the actors are doing, they have to tell us what’s going on. The writer has to find ways for the characters to comment on where they are and what they and others are doing.</li><li>Radio scenes are often shorter than stage plays.</li><li>Radio drama must not be “live” in front of an audience. Radio drama is usually recorded and played back to an audience at a different time. This means that, just like in a movie, scenes don’t have to be played back-to-back and can be played more than once to get the best shot if needed. Drama can also be edited, and audio added.</li><li>Actors do not need to learn their lines. The actors can read their lines from the script because the audience can’t see it. Actors must be familiar with their lines and rehearsed how they will use their voice to tell the audience about the character and the action.</li><li>Radio drama usually features a small cast. A small number of characters are used in each scene because it is too difficult for the audience to distinguish between voices if there are many characters. The audience can also forget that a character is “on stage” if they don’t speak for a while because they can’t be seen. Because of this, the characters must speak quite often and be involved in the plot.</li><li>Radio drama is well suited for monologue and for plays where the setting is limited and physical action is not important, such as in a prison cell or cave.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-3-tips-for-writing-radio-drama-scripts"><a href="#Part-2-3-tips-for-writing-radio-drama-scripts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 3 tips for writing radio drama scripts"></a>Part 2. 3 tips for writing radio drama scripts</h2><p>Scriptwriting is a fundamental technique of creativity, whether for content production, copywriting, or art direction. Florida International University offers the Master of Science Creative Track in collaboration with the world-renowned portfolio school Miami Ad School. If you want to become a copywriter, the program is designed to hone your writing skills for a variety of communication styles and media, such as writing for video and audio content, TV and radio commercials, and the web.</p><p>Here are some tips to become a better audio-only content writer.</p><p>Writing a script allows you to control the content, structure, and flow of the program. If the show is unscripted and organic, the host will have talking points for reference. In addition to the script, you can also play with music and sound effects.</p><h3 id="1-Keep-your-scripts-clear"><a href="#1-Keep-your-scripts-clear" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep your scripts clear"></a>1. Keep your scripts clear</h3><p>Write the script while keeping it as simple as possible. Don’t fill your sentences with words that don’t add to what you’re trying to say.</p><p>Reading from a script can make you sound a little unnatural, as well as stiff and robotic. That is a huge error. When read aloud, the script should sound natural. A more formal approach and style can result in a show that sounds unnatural and is boring.</p><p>Radio has long been a popular form of entertainment, and radio dramas or plays are an excellent way for writers to express themselves. Original stories or adaptations of novels or plays can be used in radio dramas. Radio plays, like stage plays, have scenes, sequences, and acts, but they are not always structured the same way. Radio drama allows for a great deal of flexibility and creativity, and the medium of sound is also unique.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/radio-drama-scripts-2.jpg"                      alt="keep your scripts clear"                ></p><p>Novelists and screenwriters will need to alter their writing style to write for the ear rather than the eye. Listeners cannot read the previous line or skip ahead. Everything must make sense and be visualized by the listener at that time. To convey action and drama, use dialogue, sound effects, music, and even silence. This can be completed by including specific audio cues in your script so that the show’s creators understand your vision. Keep the script as brief as possible. There can never be too much prose or long-winded dialogue in radio plays. Everything must be brief, succinct, and to the point.</p><h3 id="2-Jump-right-into-the-action"><a href="#2-Jump-right-into-the-action" class="headerlink" title="2. Jump right into the action"></a>2. Jump right into the action</h3><p>Radio drama can be more difficult because it must immediately engage listeners, or they will lose interest and switch stations or channels. The first two minutes are crucial, so start your drama at the appropriate point in the story. The rule of thumb in the radio industry is ‘arrive late, leave early.’ This means you should enter the story at a later stage when the action has begun or when a crisis has occurred. Unlike books and movies, setting, building, and background details are not required. You can save the necessary details for later in the play.</p><p>Radio scripts, like scripts, must conform to industry standards for radio program producers to find the script usable. Include scripts for music, sound effects, silence, dialogue, and other audio needs in the game so that producers can see how the script will translate into the show. Include information for the actors as well, so they can bring your vision to life. For example, use adjectives to describe how they should sound when reading their lines - sad, angry, laughing, and so on. Also, keep the number of characters to a minimum and give each one a distinct voice and style.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/radio-drama-scripts-3.jpg"                      alt="jump right into the action"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RJNYTGHVlLc?si=lhdUUVYMVQjzHXBh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Make-It-Sound-Conversational"><a href="#3-Make-It-Sound-Conversational" class="headerlink" title="3. Make It Sound Conversational"></a>3. Make It Sound Conversational</h3><p>Whether fully scripted or not, audio programs are at their best when they sound natural. Make sure your grammar is concise and to the point so that you can improvise and expand on what you’ve written.</p><p>Write like you talk. A well-written script, read word for word, should be invisible to the listener. Your script must sound natural and relaxed. Read the script out loud or have someone read it.</p><p>Can’t find people ready to help? No problem, paste the script into your text-to-speech program.

If you’re gasping in the middle of a sentence, shorten your sentences.</p><p>If the words are too difficult to express well or the meaning might be lost on the listener, try to use simple words whenever possible.

This side project became an instant success for Google and has attracted customers all around the world costing only 20$ this is one of the cheapest headsets anyone can get in the market. The best thing about Google cardboard is that the design is open source and anyone can make one at home just by following few clear instructions. Google’s vision of technology to everyone is working and cardboard is one step towards their main goal.</p><p> The Samsung Gear VR is the product that comes when you combine the expertise of the best Virtual Reality Company and the best smart phone brand in the world. Samsung Gear VR is a combined collaboration between Samsung and Oculus. This Virtual reality headset is made for only Samsung phones and retails around 100$ which is almost 5 times more than the Google cardboard.

The new VR has a USB type c port you can also switch it micro USB to make it compatible with the older versions of Samsung phones.</p><p> The best part about the new Samsung Gear is the new lens that is clearer and gives a glare free view of the screen.

Google Cardboard is a product started by Google employees as a side project but it certainly became more than a side project. The main selling point of the Cardboard is that it is really cheap and everyone can afford one. Plus you don’t need a high end smart phone to work with cardboard it can work with any android phone.

Despite this, it still supports strong syncing, and some of the collaboration features that cloud storage providers provide. Like Dropbox, it employs quick block-level synchronization to continuously sync all of your files across an infinite number of devices, including network drives. Additionally, it maintains up to 30 earlier versions of each file indefinitely, letting you access older work if necessary.</p><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>Easily backup up a physical drive</li><li>Encryption from end to end</li><li>Provides different options for transferring files</li><li>Easily sync folders</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/adobe-cloud-storage-12.JPG"                      alt="idrive price plan"                ></p><p><strong>Pricing Plan:</strong></p><p>Mini $3.71&#x2F;1st year for 100 GB</p><p>Personal $59.62&#x2F;1st year for 5TB</p><p>Team $74.62&#x2F;1st year for 5 TB and 5 computers&#x2F;5 users</p><p>Business $74.62&#x2F;1st year for 250GB, unlimited users.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FLO5dwmJAVs?si=1OYH8rv8aPaMsCiU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Conclusion-and-FAQ-1"><a href="#Part-4-Conclusion-and-FAQ-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Conclusion and FAQ"></a>Part 4: Conclusion and FAQ</h2><h3 id="1-Is-Adobe-Creative-Cloud-free-to-use-1"><a href="#1-Is-Adobe-Creative-Cloud-free-to-use-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Curving an image can be a great way to add some extra visual interest and dimension, and it’s a technique that can be used with a wide range of images. So, let’s get started!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/curve-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="curve image photoshop"                ></p><h2 id="Simple-Steps-to-Curve-an-Image-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Simple-Steps-to-Curve-an-Image-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Simple Steps to Curve an Image in Photoshop"></a>Simple Steps to Curve an Image in Photoshop</h2><h5 id="Step1Create-a-New-Document"><a href="#Step1Create-a-New-Document" class="headerlink" title="Step1Create a New Document"></a>Step1Create a New Document</h5><p>To keep things simple, let’s start with a white canvas. Let’s open a new document now by going to File in the menu bar and tapping New. Alternatively, you may press Ctrl+N or Command+N on your keyboard to generate a new document. Choose a size and orientation that is appropriate for your image.</p><h5 id="Step2Place-the-Image"><a href="#Step2Place-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step2Place the Image"></a>Step2Place the Image</h5><p>After creating the new document, open the image that you want to curve. You may do so by going to File &gt; Open in the menu bar or pressing Ctrl+O or Command+O on your keyboard. Once the image is open, go to Edit in the menu bar and select Place Embedded from the drop-down menu that appears. Select your image and click Place. The image will be placed on the canvas.

That’s why many filmmakers, editors, and colorists working on film use Look Up Tables, or LUTs, to store color grades as templates to help speed up the process.</p><p>We’re letting you know that you don’t have to work on the film to use LUTs to help personalize and mark your videos. If you’re wondering how you can get started with color grading to speed up your workflow and create better-looking shots for your business, we’ve got you covered.</p><p><strong>LUTs in Movies</strong></p><p>Various LUT types are employed during post-production for color grading and color correction.</p><p>First, the two LUT formats work differently. <strong>A 1D LUT</strong> (usually. lut format) controls a single parameter, generally gamma. A 1D LUT takes a sort of blanket approach; the adjustment applies to everything in the image without much flexibility. One parameter affects all colors, saturations, and contrast. <strong>A 3D LUT</strong> (usually a. cube format) has three axes that independently adjust Hue, Saturation, Luminance, Gamma, and Contrast and can change as conditions in the image change. As such, a 3D LUT is much more flexible and powerful and is the only way to achieve a truly cinematic color grade with LUT.</p><p>The other two types of LUTs can be either 1D or 3D LUTs, but these days they are most often 3D LUTs. The difference between them is when in the process you use them and for what purpose.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-central-3.jpg"                      alt="luts in movies"                ></p><p>An input or camera LUT used at the beginning of the color correction process adjusts the footage so that the color correction tools work correctly. Color corrected recordings that require an input or camera LUT without one can lead to unexpected and unsatisfactory results.</p><p>Conversely, you typically apply a LUT look after you’ve done color correction and moved on to the color grading phase. Use it to dial in the exact artistic look you want. The Look LUT contains instructions to create a predetermined desired look for your shots, which can be an incredible time saver in the color grading process.</p><p>Always colorize an appearance LUT correctly before applying it, as appearance LUTs assume an underlying natural color. If you don’t, you may not see the results that the LUT is supposed to give you.</p><p>LUTs are specially designed for different recording types – LOG, RAW, Rec.709, Rec.2020, HDR, and more. You can apply any LUT to any footage, but if you apply a LUT designed for a specific type of footage to another type, you can end up with a very different look than what you expected. But then it can also give you a result you like, so you are free to experiment as you wish. LUTs are non-destructive, so you can load and delete them at will.</p><p>Many camera manufacturers, software companies, and independent producers offer downloadable LUTs or LUT packs. They often design these skins for specific purposes, such as color correcting footage captured by their cameras or to mimic signature skins seen in movies and TV shows. These skins can give you exactly the color class you want, or you can use them and keep tweaking and tweaking to get the perfect look.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3UyJuZYzjt0?si=W87GeyzVKVORAk7S" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Free-LUTs-sources"><a href="#Part-3-Free-LUTs-sources" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

It has never been easier to start an online business and succeed.</p><p>There are plenty of ways to do this. But Reddit marketing is proving to be among the most promising ones. Reddit is a platform where communities of over 1.5 billion users in total gather every month.</p><p>Using the right Reddit marketing strategy can result in more sales, clients, and traffic. This guide will be your crash course on how to do Reddit marketing. Expect tons of actionable tips that will help you succeed faster.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XA_wP7rS9ww?si=LarMG3sEHAhSoL6q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-How-Does-Reddit-Work"><a href="#Part-1-How-Does-Reddit-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How Does Reddit Work?"></a>Part 1. How Does Reddit Work?</h2><p>Reddit is a place for gathering. It’s where communities of all interests can connect and share ideas, knowledge, experiences, and more.</p><p>The rules of Reddit are simple.</p><p><strong>Upvotes &amp; Downvotes</strong></p><p>First, there are Upvotes and Downvotes. This determines which posts go on top and which ones get buried down below. The more Upvotes a post has, the more it will be seen. The more Downvotes it has, the more irrelevant it becomes.</p><p><strong>SubReddits</strong></p><p>Subreddits are communities within Reddit. Each subreddit is dedicated to a topic. For example, there are subreddits about food, gaming, and finance…… you name it!</p><p>Each subreddit has its members. Some have hundreds of thousands of members, while other subreddits only have a couple of hundred or fewer.</p><p>The idea behind them is to make Reddit a more organized place where you can easily find what you’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Content and Posting</strong></p><p>The most important part of Reddit is the posts. What you post can have a significant impact on whether you reach a vast audience or not.</p><p>Ideally, posting valuable advice that will genuinely help someone out works best. However, you can also post entertaining content, personal experiences, and more.</p><p>You’ll be fine if it doesn’t go against Reddit’s guidelines.</p><p><strong>Reddit Karma</strong></p><p>Last but not least, Reddit Karma is another crucial feature. It is a status symbol. It reflects how much you contribute to each Reddit community. The more Karma you have, the more authority and value your actions on Reddit have.</p><p>You can earn more Reddit karma by receiving Upvotes on your posts and comments.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-You-Do-Reddit-Marketing"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-You-Do-Reddit-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Let’s look at some facts.</p><ul><li>Reddit currently gets <strong>1.7 billion</strong>monthly users</li><li>It is ranked <strong>#19</strong>out of all the other sites on the internet globally</li><li>It is also ranked <strong>#12</strong>among all the websites in the United States</li></ul><p>All this means is that you have billions of potential customers to reach on Reddit each month. As a result, it may be the perfect platform for you to market your business and achieve amazing results.</p><p>There are even more good news and reasons to attempt a Reddit marketing strategy for your business.</p><p>Reddit has a somewhat unique audience. Close to <strong>50%</strong> of Reddit users don’t use Instagram. A higher percentage than this don’t use TikTok as well. Additionally, <strong>90%</strong> of Reddit users go there to learn about new products and brands.</p><p>That is an excellent opportunity to use Reddit marketing for your business. It’s literally where people go to learn more about your business.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Market-on-Reddit-5-Actionable-Ways"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Market-on-Reddit-5-Actionable-Ways" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

To get good results, your content MUST help the reader in some way. Find out what your audience’s problems are and pour your heart and soul into finding a solution for them.</p><p>It will be worth it in the long run.</p><p><strong>Be Consistent and Persistent</strong></p><p>Doing one Reddit post, no matter how good it may be, will rarely do the trick. The key to creating any type of content is consistency and value.</p><p>There are three major reasons why this is crucial:</p><p>- It builds trust among your audience. This makes it easier to sell to them later</p><p>- Adds a lot to your credibility. The more you increase your credibility, the easier it is to sell to new viewers</p><p>- It gets more eyes on you. The more content you post, the more potential customers you acquire</p><p><strong>Listen to Feedback and Host AMAs</strong></p><p>AMA stands for “Ask Me Anything”. This offers a perfect opportunity for you to connect with your audience. It lets you find out more about them. This is crucial information that will help you increase your sales and make more money in the long run.</p><p>Feedback is very important for a growing business. It’s a simple way to research your audience. Remember, the more you know about their fears, issues, attractions, and similar… the more you can improve your brand and meet their demands.</p><p>Reddit has its own<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/" >AMA subreddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It currently has over 22 million members. Here, you can post who you are and what you do. Then, expect plenty of questions from your audience.</p><p><strong>Always Support Your Audience</strong></p><p>Making money is great. But, always promoting your business and talking about yourself will never bring good results. The key is to put your audience in front.</p><p>You need to care about your customers. Talk to them, offer free advice, listen to their needs, and engage more with them. The more you put their interests ahead of your own, the better the impact on your business.</p><p>For example, when a user asked “<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1fel08/what%5Fcompany%5Fhas%5Fsuch%5Fgood%5Fcustomer%5Fservice%5Fthat/" >What company has such good customer service that every other company should aspire to? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“, the comments were overflooded with the word “Amazon”.</p><p><strong>Advertise on Reddit</strong></p><p>There are two types of Reddit ads you need to be doing:</p><ul><li>Takeover Ads</li><li>Promoted Ads</li></ul><p>To be successful with your Reddit marketing strategy, you must know how to run ads.</p><p>The first step is to go over as many<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddiquette.com/reddit-ad-examples/" >examples of successful Reddit marketing campaigns <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as you can.</p><p>Second, you must familiarize yourself with<a class="link"   href="https://redditinc.force.com/helpcenter/s/article/Reddit-Advertising-Policy-Overview" >Reddit’s advertising policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Make sure you’re not creating an ad that goes against their rules.</p><p>Lastly, have a clear objective. Know why you’re creating your ad. Is it to increase your audience? Is it to get more sales? Is there another reason?</p><p>Knowing all of this will significantly improve your results and also give you insights on what type of Reddit ad to create. And now, you know how to market on Reddit. So, go out there and make this happen.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1CdWd06fCwc?si=wzg-68q0jAksPRXp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-A-Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Video-Editor-for-Reddit"><a href="#Part-4-A-Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Video-Editor-for-Reddit" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

They prefer to watch videos as opposed to reading text-based review. The demand for good review is high with companies and business looking to get reviews of their product on YouTube through popular reviewer.</p><p>YouTube is the second largest search engine after Google and has a billion users a month. This makes YouTube an attractive platform to post product reviews and build trust with consumers.</p><p>Good product review videos give that last push to your potential customers to buy the product you are endorsing. Lastly feedback from these reviews will help your viewers to either purchase or not.</p><p>Product review video creation thus became profitable career for many, so in this article will guide you to create excellent products review channel.</p><p>When creating a YouTube channel, you need to make sure that you have all the equipment needed to start making the content you have chosen which is the product review video. If you are really determined to create one, you don’t need to buy expensive vlogging equipment right away, you can use what you have now if the video is clear and the audio is good.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9wiIVztRIqQ?si=GBgdwQ78k5hbeFDv" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-are-the-things-needed-to-make-a-quality-video"><a href="#What-are-the-things-needed-to-make-a-quality-video" class="headerlink" title="What are the things needed to make a quality video?"></a>What are the things needed to make a quality video?</h2><p><strong>Camera for video:</strong> If you only have your smart phone, that’s good to go if the video is working</p><p><strong>Good Lighting:</strong> Open window for the natural sunlight to come in, better to make video around 8am to 10am you will get the good sunlight that time. But there is affordable ring light in the online shop that you can purchased. Most content creator use right light for steady light and proper video lighting</p><p><strong>Stand&#x2F;Tripod:</strong> Tripod used if you have digital camera and you can use phone stand for your mobile phone for steady video. There is also affordable stand that you can buy online</p><p><strong>Lapel Microphone:</strong> Use lapel microphone that can be connected even if you are using mobile phone for vlogging. This can make your audio quality good and clear.</p><p><strong>Place&#x2F;Studio:</strong> Find extra space in your room where you can sit to vlog properly. Also look for a good background, one that doesn’t grab the viewers’ attention much better to use plain background.</p><p><strong>Products:</strong> Products that you will make a review, the one that you think you can stand until the end. Like for example you can change the brand of the products but you should stick to that type of product, like if you want to talk about Tech then you will do all reviews about Tech, if it’s about skin care product then all the reviews should also be done about skin care.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/things-to-prepare-product-review-video.jpg"                      alt="things to prepare product review video"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RCYs8keh-Vs?si=uDC28-9yh-k6HLj4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Things-to-consider-to-start-Product-Review-Channel"><a href="#Things-to-consider-to-start-Product-Review-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Things to consider to start Product Review Channel"></a>Things to consider to start Product Review Channel</h2><h3 id="Create-a-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Create-a-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Create a YouTube Channel"></a><strong>Create a YouTube Channel</strong></h3><p>Before you do a product review, you need to create a YouTube channel where you can post the product review videos you made. There you can get paid for the videos you made thru Google Adsense when your channel is Monetized. But if you’re just starting out, don’t think that you’ll make money right away, because it’s not that easy. Before you can earn on YouTube you must first pass the requirements that YouTube asks for you to become a partner, it is to have 1,000 Subscriber and 4,000 watch hours.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/select-right-product-to-review.jpg"                      alt="select right product to review"                ></p><p>However, it’s important to note that even from there, YouTube will still evaluate your channel for other strict criteria to make sure it is complying with all their policies and best practices outside of watch time and watch hours minimums.</p><p>For now, just do you job and create a quality video to soon be monetized.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/results-of-qulaity-product-video.jpg"                      alt="results of qulaity product video"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-G7cU8dYvuI?si=JaKqRcW6qq9CDvty" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Kind-of-Products-to-Review"><a href="#Kind-of-Products-to-Review" class="headerlink" title="Kind of Products to Review"></a><strong>Kind of Products to Review</strong></h3><p>Start by reviewing products you have, because nobody is going to give out a free product to someone who’s never uploaded a review. Of course, it’s important from the starts you really need to invest in the product you want to review, so you can start a video reviewing product on your channel if that’s the content you’ve chosen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/decide-product-review-type.jpg"                      alt="decide product review type"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fm0XhU5H8R4?si=cFPk6XK3X3CQSI7Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>For the Brand to notice your video, buy some of their products that you think useful to you and make a review about it, make sure to make a video review creative to stands out to another reviewer. So that when the Brands see your video they will be amazed by at your work. But just make sure that the product your reviewing is approved to or you don’t have any issue with the products, because remember it’s not just the Brand eyeing to your work but the viewers are also looking for such a review.</p><p>When you have a lot of product review video on you channel, other Brands will approach you to offer you to do a review on their product and sometime they also offer payment. But they only offer the payment when they think it’s worth it or they get some sales. In regard with this I’m talking about your community or Subscribers count, because Brands only offer payment for your video if you have stable or more subscribers’ count. So, if you don’t have many subscribers yet, you need to work hard to increase your viewers and patient is more important in this kind of field.</p><p>I recommend sticking with the same kind of products and specialize so that the viewers will familiar that you are the one doing that kind of review. They know immediately whose channel they should search of they ever need your review.</p><h3 id="Script-about-the-Products"><a href="#Script-about-the-Products" class="headerlink" title="Script about the Products"></a><strong>Script about the Products</strong></h3><p>Here is some basic information on how you make a quality script</p><ol><li>The basic information about the products example the price, size, ingredients and or materials</li><li>Where you got</li><li>What you liked about the products</li><li>What you didn’t like</li><li>Worth to buy or not</li><li>Recommendation or your personal thoughts about the product</li></ol><p>Just like product demo videos, product review videos also need a proper script before recording so that you cover everything that you want to without missing any key aspects of the product that you’re reviewing. Keep the review short and to the point because potential customers have come to your channel to watch the review of the product in the market. Concentrate on the products and explain the features in detail to help users determine if the products suit them. You can add your opinion to humanize the product features. As an Influencer, the main purpose of doing product review is to get people to buy the products you feature. You need to build credibly with customers for them to buy what you recommend. To achieve this, you need to give your genuine review by highlight the pros and cons of the product. This will get you the potential customer or subscriber who will happy to buy the products you are endorsing.</p><h3 id="Good-Editing"><a href="#Good-Editing" class="headerlink" title="Good Editing"></a><strong>Good Editing</strong></h3><p>Editing is important if you want to look good. People don’t like to watch long boring video so try making video short crisp and try a good reliable video editing software.

Expect it to take a months before get notice of people, getting subscriber is complicated and you feel like giving up, but the more reviews you have, the better. Thus, in the beginning you won’t make anything until you put in the work, but you can see how you can go from 0 subscribers or views to 1000 once you build up a nice content, all from your single YouTube channel. Remember that give your best in every video you make because one day your hard work will pay off.
