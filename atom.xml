Don’t panic, we got you covered with the step-by-step instructions to create a .srt subtitle file and such a computer.</p><p>The process of creating a .srt file for video on Mac is quite similar to .srt file creation on Windows. You don’t require the installation of a third-party program. However, on Mac, you’ll use TextEdit as Notepad is not supported.</p><p>Let’s proceed to the stepwise guide on how to make an SRT file by yourself for video on Mac without wasting time;</p><p>Step1 Turn on your Mac computer and start TextEdit.</p><p>Step2 Create a new file. But before writing any subtitle captions, play the video whose subtitle you want to write and listen to the first line of the audio.</p><p>After you’ve grabbed the first line, type 1 and write the first Timestamp in hours:minutes: seconds, milliseconds.</p><p>Here is an example of what you should do;</p><p><em>1</em></p><p><em>00:00:07,114 –&gt; 00:00:11,834</em></p><p>As mentioned earlier, the times indicate the beginning and end of when the subtitle appears on the screen.</p><p>Step3 Type your subtitle content in the next line. If it’s a long text, you need to break it down into multiple subtitles.</p><p>Step4 Repeat step 2&amp;3 for the remaining subtitle contents.</p><p>See what an SRT subtitle looks like below;</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-for-video-on-mac-1.jpg"                      alt="an example of an srt subtitle on mac"                ></p><p>Step5 Review and edit the subtitle.</p><p>Step6 To complete the operation, click <strong>‘File’</strong> at the top bar and select <strong>Save</strong> from the drop-down. Then navigate to ‘<strong>Save As’</strong> and type your file name, and change the extension from .txt to .srt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-for-video-on-mac-2.jpg"                      alt="click on file"                ></p><p>Make sure you Uncheck the ‘Hide Extension’ and ‘If no extension is provided’ checkboxes.

Or are the products that I’m doing a review is sponsored or paid? So, in this article let’s talk about this most ask questions.</p><p>With more people looking to make extra money these days, many companies have taken advantage of this and pay people to test their products before sending them to market.</p><p>What you need to understand is that companies are only looking for certain people to test product not all are qualified but there are certain that is willing to do some product testing or product review vlog.</p><p>Being a paid product reviewer is now easier than ever before, but it does take a little work and sometime good timing to get the right opportunity. Not only does being paid product reviewer get you some extra money, but you also get free products too!</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-Product-Review-Vlogs"><a href="#What-is-Product-Review-Vlogs" class="headerlink" title="What is Product Review Vlogs"></a>What is Product Review Vlogs</h2><p>When you think of YouTube reviews, you tend to think of videos where the YouTuber lays out the details of the product, perhaps talks about the kind of use cases you would want it for, and maybe even compares it to similar products. In reality, review videos can be ridiculously over the top or unconventional. But nevertheless, gives the viewer all the information that a review would give.</p><p>Product Review or Product testing is a way for companies to get real user feedback on a product or service before pushing it to market. To do this, companies ship you a free physical product to use in exchange for a candid review. At the end of the testing period, they typically let you keep the item. Some might even pay you in cash. But in case-to-case basis, most company varies to pay content creator when the channel audience statistics are good.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/set-up-camera-mayang.jpg"                      alt="set up camera mayang"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136548/16384" target="_top" id="2136548">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136548" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136548/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Get-Paid-to-Review-Products"><a href="#How-to-Get-Paid-to-Review-Products" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Paid to Review Products"></a>How to Get Paid to Review Products</h2><p>You must have a channel that is stable in a sense with good statistics especially in the audience</p><p>There are companies that want you to have at least 1000 Subscribers on your YouTube channel and at least 1000 followers on Facebook page, Instagram and even TikTok account. Companies also choose YouTubers who they think can do what they want well. They also look at the audience statistic of the channel, from there they will also know what product they are offering and how much payment they can pay for the review.</p><p>One of the great things about YouTube, both as a source of income and as a creative outlet, is that there are so many ways to be successful.</p><p>This kind of work is not easy, especially when you’re doing a skin care products review there are times that the products is not suitable for your skin type, you can feel itchy and sore. So, you have to be very carefully in accepting products to review, do some research about the product ingredients, you know your skin type so it is easy for you to identified if it’s good for you or not. It’s not because you will receive free products and payment for review, immediately you will accept the offer, you must consider the product if its compatible to your skin because at the end of the day it’s your skin, it’s your channel who will sacrifice if you make a wrong decision.</p><p>The next universal thing you do is be honest with your viewers when making sponsored content.</p><p>This applies to YouTubers of all stripes, but even more so when we’re talking about YouTubers who review products. If you have been paid to do a particular review, regardless of whether the review is 100% honest and not flattering at all for the product, even if all the company did was send you a free product to do the review with and aren’t actually paying you, you need to tell your viewers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/product-review-video-mayang.jpg"                      alt="product review video mayang"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettifr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2145082/17095" target="_top" id="2145082">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17095-2145082" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettifr.pxf.io/i/5597632/2145082/17095"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137226/26400" target="_top" id="2137226">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137226" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137226/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-Much-is-Product-Reviewer-Talent-Fee"><a href="#How-Much-is-Product-Reviewer-Talent-Fee" class="headerlink" title="How Much is Product Reviewer Talent Fee"></a>How Much is Product Reviewer Talent Fee</h2><p>As a YouTuber, talent fee is the fee given by the companies when a person reviews their product. The payments depend on your channel status and other social media account.</p><p>Sometime companies ask you to cross posted your review to all your social media account because based on them there are also followers on social media that is not a subscriber. They also want a wide market for you to post their products.</p><p>As for the charging of the companies, it depends on you, if you think your skills in vlogging are enough, then you can ask for higher payment but if you think the price is reasonable for your hard work just go for it. The companies will still negotiate with you regarding the price so you should open to that and should level the price you charge to the company with your work. Sometime they also offer an ex-deal, meaning half of the payment is products then half of it is money. Example you ask for payment like 100$, 250$ of that is worth of all products and the another 250$ will pay thru your preferred bank. So, you will receive a lot of product amounting of the asking price. The question is, what will you do of those products? You can have it for your raffles or giveaways for your channel in that way you can attract more viewers and subscriber and you can also sell that to convert the products into cash. But also check the contract if that way is allowed, because sometimes companies also have restrictions regarding ex-deals. Remember to always read carefully the contract before signing so you won’t have any problem in the long run.</p><p><strong>My Example of Rate Card</strong></p><p><strong>Rate of (Amount) for</strong></p><ol><li>1 YouTube Vlog about the product</li><li>1 IG repost of the YT Vlog (to be posted on feed) cross-posted to Facebook</li><li>1 IG Story</li><li>1 TikTok Video</li></ol><p><strong>Things to Remember to do a Quality Product Review Vlog</strong></p><p>In order for you to have paid product reviews you need to consider the following</p><p><strong>Quality Videos</strong></p><p>You need to make quality videos, because of course the companies don’t just look at the channel statistics, they also check if you make a video that approved to their standard. The video you make is will be used or posted to their website or other social media platform that is why work hard to make your video stand out to the company.</p><p><strong>Perfect Equipment for Vlogging</strong></p><p>Have at least the equipment for vlogging is good because of course it’s embarrassing for the company that you will receive payment and then the video is blurry and the audio is noisy. It’s about time to invest in the vlogging equipment if you receive such offer, that’s for the quality video’s sake.</p><p><strong>Quality Content</strong></p><p>It’s not just the video only that are good, the content should also be well made, think about your work carefully so that you don’t embarrass the brand and your subscriber. It’s not just that you review a product on the channel, you should also think of other ways to create quality content be creative and wise in making good content. Remember there are a lot of Youtuber that same content as you.</p><p><strong>Editing Software</strong></p><p>In order to say that you have made quality content and quality video, when it comes to editing your work must be done well. There are people who are good at editing, they give so much time and effort to make their video creative to stands out to other channel.

In fact, according to a recent study, 92% of consumers say they heavily rely on online reviews and testimonials when making purchasing decisions. 88% of those consumers say they trust those testimonials as much as personal recommendations from their friends, family members, and colleagues. This means that if you can get your clients or customers talking about how great your products or services are on camera, it will help them make buying decisions, reinforce your brand message and build relationships with their followers and peers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/video-testimonial.jpg"                      alt="video testimonial"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Why-Video-Testimonials-Are-Important-for-Marketing"><a href="#Why-Video-Testimonials-Are-Important-for-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Why Video Testimonials Are Important for Marketing"></a>Why Video Testimonials Are Important for Marketing</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098705/14409" target="_top" id="2098705">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098705" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098705/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Video-testimonials-help-customers-make-their-buying-decisions"><a href="#Video-testimonials-help-customers-make-their-buying-decisions" class="headerlink" title="Video testimonials help customers make their buying decisions"></a>Video testimonials help customers make their buying decisions</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/help-customers-decisions.jpg"                      alt="help customers decisions"                ></p><p>Video testimonials are an amazing way to demonstrate the value of your business. They help customers make their buying decisions, they’re more effective than written testimonials, and they are more authentic and believable than the written ones.</p><p>Video testimonials help reinforce your company’s message. When you see a product or service demonstrated in action by someone who is actually using it in real life—which is what happens when you watch a video—you can get a much better understanding of what it does for people who experience it firsthand. This can make an enormous difference when trying to convey the benefits of something like an electric toothbrush or headphones compared to just reading about them on paper or hearing about them from someone else who may not be fully knowledgeable about how awesome these products really are!</p><p>It also helps build relationships with potential clients because videos allow us to connect with people on a personal level in ways that would otherwise be impossible through text-only formats such as email messages only ever so briefly exchanged between two parties before being quickly forgotten forever when we move onto other things.</p><h3 id="Video-testimonials-help-reinforce-your-company’s-message"><a href="#Video-testimonials-help-reinforce-your-company’s-message" class="headerlink" title="Video testimonials help reinforce your company’s message"></a>Video testimonials help reinforce your company’s message</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/reinforce-company-message.jpg"                      alt="reinforce company message"                ></p><p>Video testimonials are a great way to reinforce your company’s message and make potential customers feel like they know you, your business, and your products.</p><p>When customers see another person saying good things about their service, it makes them more likely to trust and use that service themselves. Video testimonials can help you reach a larger audience by being shared on social media, review sites, and other marketing channels.</p><p>If you want to build trust with your audience, having real people talk about their experiences in using your products is a great way to do it. Video testimonials can help you get more customers by showing them that other people have had good experiences with your product and that it does what it says it does. They can also help you sell more because when someone sees someone else saying how much they love a product, they will think “hey, maybe I should try this too.”</p><h3 id="Video-testimonials-are-more-authentic-and-believable-than-written-ones"><a href="#Video-testimonials-are-more-authentic-and-believable-than-written-ones" class="headerlink" title="Video testimonials are more authentic and believable than written ones"></a>Video testimonials are more authentic and believable than written ones</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/authentic-video-testimonial.jpg"                      alt="authentic video testimonial"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424531">                    <video width="864" height="NaN" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424531.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424531">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424531.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424531%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424531/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Of course, written testimonials are still a great way to get your message across. However, video testimonials have some distinct advantages that make them more effective.</p><p>Consider this: Your prospective customer is going to be much more likely to click on the “read more” link in a written testimonial than they would be if you presented the same information in video form. That’s because videos are more memorable and emotional than text; they’re also more authentic and believable.</p><h3 id="Video-testimonials-help-build-relationships"><a href="#Video-testimonials-help-build-relationships" class="headerlink" title="Video testimonials help build relationships"></a>Video testimonials help build relationships</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/video-testimonial-build-relationships.jpg"                      alt="video testimonial build relationships"                ></p><p>As you know, there are lots of ways to market your business.

Because they’re personal, they allow you to showcase the client’s experience with your company, and they’re easy for people to share on social media!</p><p>If you haven’t done so already, we highly recommend that you start gathering video testimonials from all of your happy customers.

However, before you start sharing your tunes, you must ensure you understand its music copyright rules.</p><p>In this article, we’ll give you a comprehensive guide to understanding <strong>Instagram’s rules about copyright music.</strong> We’ll also discuss a few tips for staying compliant and avoiding any potential copyright issues.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-Does-Instagram-Detect-Copyright-Music"><a href="#How-Does-Instagram-Detect-Copyright-Music" class="headerlink" title="How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?"></a>How Does Instagram Detect Copyright Music?</h2><p>Instagram has an automated system that generally detects copyrighted content in user posts, live shows, or IGTV. Even though the system is automated, mistakes can still occur; however, this wouldn’t stop the platform from taking down posts or videos entirely from user profiles.</p><p>Instagram’s recently improved copyright infringement detection system now detects copyrighted music in content. The service sends a pop-up notification to the users, which gives them time to either stop using the track or change it in their posts.</p><p>Here’s what happens to your Instagram account if the system detects copyrighted content:</p><ul><li>Your post may be muted on Instagram.</li><li>Instagram notifies you to take the track down if you’re broadcasting a track during a Livestream.</li><li>Instagram may take down your post entirely.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/copyright-music-on-instagram-1.jpg"                      alt="instagram copyright notification"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123733/7443" target="_top" id="2123733">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123733" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123733/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Instagram-Music-Copyright-Rules"><a href="#Instagram-Music-Copyright-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Instagram Music Copyright Rules"></a>Instagram Music Copyright Rules</h2><p>Below are the three general copyright principles you should keep in mind when using music on Instagram:</p><ul><li><strong>Apply A Video When Sharing Music:</strong> Instagram allows you to share a recording of an artist or band performing live and applying music to a short video.</li><li><strong>Keep The Video Short:</strong> Make sure your video is short because if you post a more extended clip with copyrighted music, Instagram’s detection system will limit your content.</li><li><strong>Unlimited Music For Your Instagram Stories:</strong> If you share a story on Instagram, the platform allows you to add unlimited copyrighted music to it from its built-in music library.</li></ul><h3 id="1-How-To-Use-Copyright-Music-On-Instagram"><a href="#1-How-To-Use-Copyright-Music-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="(1) How To Use Copyright Music On Instagram"></a>(1) How To Use Copyright Music On Instagram</h3><p>There are several workarounds for using <strong>copyrighted music on Instagram:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Collaborating With Artists Or Musicians:</strong> Reach out to local musicians or new artists to see if you can collaborate and create custom sounds for your Instagram videos. Not only will you have copyright-free music that you can use, but you will also support independent artists!</li><li><strong>Asking For Permission:</strong> To avoid copyright issues on Instagram, you can contact the creator to seek permission before using their content.</li><li><strong>Pay For The Copyrighted Music:</strong> You can opt to pay for royalty-free music on your IG posts, live streams, or IGTV from various online libraries, such as <a class="link"   href="https://pixabay.com/" >Pixaby, <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://soundcloud.com/" >SoundCloud <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/apple-music/" >Apple Music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</li><li><strong>Give Credit In Your Caption:</strong> To use copyrighted music on your IG content, make sure to give credit to the original creator in your post’s caption.</li><li><strong>Post Instagram Reel Videos:</strong> Reels are short videos of about 15 seconds with a built-in music feature that applies a sticker to your content with the song’s details and can save you from Instagram copyright music issues.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Using-Filmora-To-Avoid-Copyright-Issue-And-Post-Your-Videos-On-Instagram"><a href="#2-Using-Filmora-To-Avoid-Copyright-Issue-And-Post-Your-Videos-On-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="(2) Using Filmora To Avoid Copyright Issue And Post Your Videos On Instagram"></a>(2) Using Filmora To Avoid Copyright Issue And Post Your Videos On Instagram</h3><p>Copyright can be a tricky thing, especially when it comes to posting music videos on Instagram.

The Yi 4k action cam appears more trendy and sleek with its smooth plastic finish and the attractive rounded corners. Whereas, SJ6 has a rugged appearance with rubberized material that provides textured finish with added grip. You will also find few indicating LEDs on SJ6 body.</p><p> Yi Action cam is designed with a 2.19” LCD screen but SJ6 has little smaller up to 2” only. You will find MicroSD and MicroUSB slots on Yi’s body but in case of SJ6, MiniUSB, MicroSD and Micro HDMI make connectivity much easier. Another difference lies in their buttons as Yi 4K has only on button on its body but you will find 3 control buttons on SJ6 Legend.</p><h4 id="Accessories"><a href="#Accessories" class="headerlink" title="Accessories"></a>Accessories</h4><p> Second noticeable difference is in accessories of both action cam units. Note that, both of these companies are offering cameras with threaded tripod type hole on bottom side of their body so that users can easily attach them to mounts. But you will find more flexibility with SJ6 as its box includes all necessary mounts that can meet action recording needs with ease. On the other side, Yi 4K box does not even offer a waterproof case to buyers. You have to make all the expenses yourself to fulfill your needs. You will find so many expensive combos for Yi accessories over online stores.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >More Accessories You May Need <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="Battery-Life"><a href="#Battery-Life" class="headerlink" title="Battery Life"></a>Battery Life</h4><p> In this case, Yi 4K action cam wins the battle with its ability to record 4k videos tirelessly up to 120 minutes with 30fps setting. For SJ6 legend, you will be able to enjoy maximum recording time up to 70 minutes with 4K settings at 25 fps. It is essential to keep Wi-Fi and screen off to gain this much performance from SJ6 otherwise you will find faster decay in battery percentage. Yi 4k battery is designed with fine tuned advanced power management system that leads to higher service capacity.</p><h4 id="Waterproof"><a href="#Waterproof" class="headerlink" title="Waterproof"></a>Waterproof</h4><p> If you are a underwater adventure lover then Yi 4K cannot provide your more satisfactory service because it can go underwater up to 40 meters and this dive is not possible without protective case. The sad part is that the camera box doesn’t include case so you have to make additional payment to buy it. SJ6 legend is designed to offer impressive underwater performance with its ability to go underwater up to 30 meters with ease and a sturdy, sleek, well designed waterproof case is included in its package.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135405/19272" target="_top" id="2135405">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135405" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135405/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Features-and-Performance-Comparison"><a href="#Features-and-Performance-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance Comparison"></a>Features and Performance Comparison</h2><h4 id="Video-and-Image-Quality"><a href="#Video-and-Image-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Video and Image Quality"></a>Video and Image Quality</h4><p> When we moved to the video quality test then Yi 4K offered quite appealing results. This camera is designed with native 4k resolution so that crystal clear footage can be recorded with impressive results. But in case of SJ6 you will find interpolated 4K technology; it means that your device actually captures all details in 2K resolution mode but the final footage get produced with 4K result where additional 2K is increased with addition of fake pixels during processing. The image quality with such interpolated system goes really bad. But if you compare performance of both devices at Full HD 1080p resolution level then you will be able to find impressive quality with Yi cam and it also provides support to 120fps frame rate at 1080p.</p><h4 id="Audio-Quality"><a href="#Audio-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Audio Quality"></a>Audio Quality</h4><p> You will be glad to know that Yi 4K action cam support 360 degree omni directional coverage with microphones and it also has powerful built in speakers.

Sometimes, the smallest of things can be just as inspiring as the biggest, but when did you last stop and really look at what’s around? From the tiniest insect to the patterns on a leaf, starting to see things through different eyes can put a whole new spin on the world around us.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/close-up-photography-iphone.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Image source: Impressive Magazine</p><p>Macro and close-up photography is a great way to start appreciating the little things in life, and you don’t need a fancy camera to get involved either.

What is close-up and macro photography?"></a>Section 1. What is close-up and macro photography?</h2><p>Close-up photography and macro photography are all about photographing things in a way that makes them appear larger than they are in real life. It lets us look in detail at the things around us and can be an exciting and dramatic way to shoot images. But is there a difference between close up and macro in photography terms?</p><p>There is, so if you’re looking to get to grips with this type of photography, you need to understand that:</p><ul><li><strong>Close up photography</strong> is about putting your iPhone camera physically close to the object you are photographing, but without using any peripherals or special apps.</li><li>**<strong>Macro photography uses technology to actually increase the size of the image to allow a close-up photo without needing to be so physically close.</strong></li></ul><p>With your iPhone macro photography and close-up shooting are both possible and can bring great results if you know what you’re doing. However, for the really professional touch, an investment in a macro lens or specialist app will certainly kick your photography skills into high gear.</p><h2 id="Section-2-iPhone-Macro-Photography-Tips"><a href="#Section-2-iPhone-Macro-Photography-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Section 2. iPhone Macro Photography Tips"></a>Section 2. iPhone Macro Photography Tips</h2><p>Taking great photos in macro mode isn’t always as easy as it looks. Novice users can become frustrated when images come out dark, blurry or out of focus. Here are some top tips to get your iPhone macro photography just right, and to start building a collection of gorgeous close up images.</p><h4 id="Tip1-Find-your-light"><a href="#Tip1-Find-your-light" class="headerlink" title="Tip1. Find your light"></a>Tip1. Find your light</h4><p>Shooting in the macro range requires decent lighting, so consider when and how you are positioning your images. Early morning and midafternoon are great times of day to plan a shoot, as the soft, natural light is ideal for macro photography. Taking photos in the blazing midday sun can cause overexposure, and your iPhone may struggle to focus too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/close-up-photography-light.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Image source: Urdu-Mag.com</p><p>If you do want to snap some macro images in bright sunlight, try positioning your shadow to create a more indirect lighting of the subject. You can also move your own orientation so that the sun is shining into your shot, rather than behind it.</p><h4 id="Tip2-Focus-is-the-key"><a href="#Tip2-Focus-is-the-key" class="headerlink" title="Tip2. Focus is the key"></a>Tip2. Focus is the key</h4><p>With any photo, focus is crucial to an awesome result. But when you’re creating macro images, this becomes even more critical to the success of your photography. Try using the manual focus setting to give yourself more control over your focus point, and work on fine-tuning your skills to create the perfect image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/close-up-photography-focus.jpg"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130873/7443" target="_top" id="2130873">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130873" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130873/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Image source: PicMonkey</p><p>If you’re not ready to go fully manual, you could try using the iPhone’s locking feature to lock the focus into place and avoid the photo being ruined by a little wobble on your part. To use this, simply tap and hold the screen at the part of the image you want to be in focus, and you’ll see AE&#x2F;EF Lock appear at the bottom. This means both focus and lighting are fixed until you tap elsewhere on the screen to release it.</p><h4 id="Tip3-Keep-steady"><a href="#Tip3-Keep-steady" class="headerlink" title="Tip3. Keep steady"></a>Tip3. Keep steady</h4><p>Keeping still when taking a macro shot is absolutely vital. With your image already enlarged, any wobbles or shakes will cause blur or a loss of focus and spoil your image. In the longer term, you may want to invest in a tripod to steady the phone, but if you’re just starting out, you might not be keen just yet.</p><p>If you don’t own a tripod, you could use a stationary object nearby, such as a wall, rock or gate. You could also bring a beanbag with you, as these allow you to get up close and personal with your subject comfortably, whilst also supporting and steadying your phone for the shot.</p><h4 id="Tip4-Don’t-get-too-close"><a href="#Tip4-Don’t-get-too-close" class="headerlink" title="Tip4. Don’t get too close"></a>Tip4. Don’t get too close</h4><p>Hold your finger close to your face, and you’ll find that at a certain distance you can no longer focus on it. The same principle is true for iPhone macro photography; if you get too close your image will start to blur. But how close is too close?</p><p>Different iPhone iterations have slightly different lenses, so there will be a bit of trial and error involved to find the perfect distance for your model. Somewhere in the range of two to four inches tends to be about the limit and is more than close enough to allow you to take some stunning close-up photographs.</p><h4 id="Tip5-Be-simple"><a href="#Tip5-Be-simple" class="headerlink" title="Tip5. Be simple"></a>Tip5. Be simple</h4><p>When you’re shooting macro images with your iPhone, the intention is to make the background somewhat blurry, with only the objects at the front of the image in focus. You might think that this means it doesn’t matter what’s actually in the background, but in reality, a busy background with mixed colors can still serve to spoil your image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macro-photography-distance.jpg"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918703/19272" target="_top" id="1918703">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918703" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918703/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Image source: GCFLearnFree</p><p>Make the subject center stage by positioning your composition to give the least cluttered background possible. Use the sky if you can, or experiment with textured backgrounds such as a wall or fence. Think about how far your subject is from the background, as the further away the background is, the more blurry it will become and the greater the contrast of focus on your subject will appear.</p><h4 id="Tip6-Composition"><a href="#Tip6-Composition" class="headerlink" title="Tip6. Composition"></a>Tip6. Composition</h4><p>If you’ve researched photography in general, you’ll already have heard of the ‘rule of thirds’. This rule is super simple to apply when using an iPhone and is just as relevant in macro photography as it is when shooting landscapes or any other composition.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macro-photography-composition.jpg"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036501/19272" target="_top" id="2036501">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036501" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036501/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Image source: SmashingHub</p><p>The rule states that if the image were divided into thirds horizontally and vertically, the most important objects in the image should be placed at the points where the lines intersect. This is easy on iPhone, as you can switch on the gridlines and instantly see where to place the subject in the photos. When shooting macro images, place your focal point at one of the intersections to give your photo the professional touch.</p><h4 id="Tip7-Try-different-angles"><a href="#Tip7-Try-different-angles" class="headerlink" title="Tip7. Try different angles"></a>Tip7. Try different angles</h4><p>iPhone macro photography is all about looking at the world in a different way. To really accentuate this quality in your work, why not try shooting from a different perspective? Get very low down and shoot your subject from below, with the sky as a background, or snap from directly above to add drama to your images.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macro-photography-angles.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Image source: Flickr</p><p>Look for interesting colors and play with the light. Let the sunshine through the leaves of the plant or find a puddle and play with reflections. Line yourself up with a cityscape or countryside landscape, then place the subject dangling in the foreground. Have fun with angles and discover new ways of looking at your surroundings.</p><h4 id="Tip8-Waterdrop-trick"><a href="#Tip8-Waterdrop-trick" class="headerlink" title="Tip8. Waterdrop trick"></a>Tip8. Waterdrop trick</h4><p>If you’re yet to invest in a macro lens for your iPhone, water can be your friend, adding a new level of magnification to your image. A small drop of water is a powerful magnifier and applying it carefully to your iPhone lens can make close-up photography even better.</p><p>A larger drop that is almost ready to plop off will give magnificent magnification, but you’ll have to have a steady hand and fast shutter finger to enjoy the result. Applying a huge droplet will give a dramatic result, softly blurred at the edges and sharply in focus at the center.</p><p>Do be careful not to soak your iPhone while you’re playing with this trick!</p><h4 id="Tip9-Use-a-macro-lens"><a href="#Tip9-Use-a-macro-lens" class="headerlink" title="Tip9. Use a macro lens"></a>Tip9. Use a macro lens</h4><p>If you’re serious about achieving incredible iPhone macro photography, the very best shots are only possible with a purpose-built macro lens. Simple, clip-on lenses will elevate the results to new heights, letting you take immaculately detailed, super close up shots that look like they were done on an expensive professional camera.</p><p>There are a number of iPhone macro lenses out there that will do a great job and won’t necessarily cost the earth. The <a class="link"   href="https://www.olloclip.com/" >Olloclip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://photojojo.com/" >Photojojo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are both under $100, and let you add the pro touch to every photograph you set up. These are lightweight, easy to fit, and well worth the investment for the keen close up photographer.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>If you’re fed up with the same old shots and want to try something different, delving into the world of macro photography with your iPhone could give you a new lease of life. Whether you dive right in with a purchase of a clip-on lens or simply start looking at the little details in everything around you, close up photography is fun and easy to get into for every iPhone user.</p><p>Explore, experiment, and practice, and you’ll soon find your own style and be the envy of all your followers.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135401/19272" target="_top" id="2135401">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135401" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135401/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-tying-iphone-videos-in-seamless-bundles/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Tying IPhone Videos in Seamless Bundles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-a-duel-of-viewers-google-cardboard-vs-samsung-vr/"><u>[New] A Duel of Viewers Google Cardboard Vs.

But reviews reveal that it is also good to buy a bigger sensor that ensures brighter viewfinder along with larger focus. There is no doubt to say that market is loaded with lots of full frame models, the examples include Nikon D610 and Canon EOS 6D and you will be glad to know that cost of these cameras is now dropping day by day so you can have a better option for purchase even at low investment.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-choose-the-right-4K-Full-Frame-Camera"><a href="#How-to-choose-the-right-4K-Full-Frame-Camera" class="headerlink" title="How to choose the right 4K Full Frame Camera?"></a>How to choose the right 4K Full Frame Camera?</h2><h4 id="Section-1-What-is-Full-Frame"><a href="#Section-1-What-is-Full-Frame" class="headerlink" title="Section 1: What is Full-Frame?"></a>Section 1: What is Full-Frame?</h4><p> You might be interested to know about the term Full Frame as it is one of the biggest consideration for buying 4K cameras. Actually, the term Full Frame is a feature of digital sensors and it indicates that camera sensor is having size same as that of old 35mm film strip. In simple works, while buying a new 4K camera, you need not to make hard efforts to calculate the Full Frame rate abilities rather you simply need to check its focal length value and that will provide you information about Full Frame rating. When you have a full frame type DSLR then you can expect much higher file sizes for every shot because it ensures higher megapixel count for every collection.</p><h4 id="Section-2-4K-Full-Frame-Camera-Buying-Advice"><a href="#Section-2-4K-Full-Frame-Camera-Buying-Advice" class="headerlink" title="Section 2: 4K Full Frame Camera Buying Advice"></a>Section 2: 4K Full Frame Camera Buying Advice</h4><p> While buying a new 4K camera you must check few specifications to ensure great results. Some of the essential considerations include size, weight, speed, still and video quality and cost of the lens. If we talk about most commonly used digital SLR cameras then they are often available with 30 ounce weight range whereas the specially designed action cameras such as Nikon D5 use to be heavier comparatively. Generally, professionals need to carry so many accessories for their shoots so their bags get too bulky; that is why they often search for light weight solutions.</p><p> You might have heard that mirrorless lenses use to be light in weight but actually they are light up to certain limit only. Also, it is not necessary that a camera that has great video quality will offer great image response too; it may vary. For example, Sony Mirrorless A7S is well known for its high quality video responses but its quality decays for still that is limited only up to 12.2MP.</p><p> Action shooters seek higher camera speeds so they often count on frames per second. But if you are beginner and want to use your camera for simple photography applications then you need not to worry about this factor. Other than this, you also need to focus upon lens quality but at the same time it will boost up your cost so pick the one with most satisfactory details as per your indented applications.</p><h2 id="Top-5-Full-Frame-4K-Cameras-in-2018"><a href="#Top-5-Full-Frame-4K-Cameras-in-2018" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 Full Frame 4K Cameras in 2018"></a>Top 5 Full Frame 4K Cameras in 2018</h2><h4 id="1-Canon-EOS-5D-Mark-IV"><a href="#1-Canon-EOS-5D-Mark-IV" class="headerlink" title="1.

After all, a longer flight life means the longer you have to make sure you get your perfect shot (video or still frame,) or are able to more thoroughly inspect whatever it is you are looking to inspect. Basically, at the end of the day a longer flight time directly relates to having more fun.</p><p>While it is true that you can (and should) carry some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >extra batteries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with you while piloting your drone, stopping what you are doing to change batteries out can be a real hassle, and a drain on your productivity. That is why drone enthusiasts need to make sure they check out these drones because of their long flight time.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on

Thanks to its four foldable arms, this drone is perfect to be packed away to take on exotic shooting locations. However, one of the main features, aside from its size, is the Follow Me feature that this drone comes equipped with. This feature allows the drone to focus in on its uses (thanks to the smart watch controls,) and automatically follow you as you go for a run, walk or even play a little flag football. The Follow Me feature allows the camera to focus in on you, capturing all your activities. The Sim Too Pro has a flight life of about 30 min., with a control range of 1,000m. Thanks to its size, and Follow Me features, this long lasting drone is worth the £352.01 it costs.</p><h3 id="3-DJI-Phantom-4"><a href="#3-DJI-Phantom-4" class="headerlink" title="3.

If you have installed the battery and memory card then maximum weight of Hero5 Black will go up to 4.2 Oz or 118 grams whereas on the other side the Hero4 Silver possess overall weight of 2.9 Oz or 82 grams without additional housing and it can go up to 5.1 Oz or a45 grams with standard housing arrangement.</p><p> As the camera body is itself designed to be waterproof so naturally Hero5 is little bigger then Hero4 Silver</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Waterproof:</strong></li></ol><p> The best thing to know is that these new designs never demand any additional housing arrangements because the built in type casing is itself water proof up to 33 feet and it also adds protection against sand and dust. That means this latest model is especially designed to serve users in rough weather conditions.</p><p> With the old unit you can go down up to 131 feet as its water proof housing can keep it safe under water while you are shooting recreational videos. But it is not possible with Hero5 Black because it is safe only up to 33 feet. In case if you want to go for scuba diving with this unit then it is good to buy additional super suit type housing for your new camera unit but it will definitely affect your budget.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Battery:</strong></li></ol><p> Both these competing camera units use to have removable batteries so if you are planning to go for a long tour then you can take additional batteries with you. But it is important to note that batteries of both these devices are constructed uniquely so you cannot replace their batteries.</p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Accessories:</strong></li></ol><p> Although few basic accessories of your old Hero4 Silver camera can be connected to Hero5 Black but not all of them can be utilized like this. You can check the basic specifications of both these devices to grab an idea about which parts are compatible or which are not.</p><ol start="5"><li><strong>Touch Screen:</strong></li></ol><p> Both editions have built in type touch screen display that assist users in easy navigation. The new model is designed with advanced touch screen abilities that help users to control everything in much better manner and this touch sensitivity also leads to sharper details and improved contrast.</p><h4 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance:"></a><strong>Performance:</strong></h4><ol><li><strong>Video and Stills:</strong></li></ol><p> It is believed to receive almost equal video clarity with both these devices as manufacturers have not upgraded the sensors for video system this time again. People were waiting so long to have a GoPro camera that can serve users with classic sensors even at low light areas but may be this feature will be added into Hero6 platform. The 4K abilities and 1080p resolution all use to provide almost equal results and even the frame rates are also equal.</p><p> If you love to capture photographs then also you will have almost similar picture quality from both these cameras. The maximum supported pixel quality is 12 MP that results in 4000*3000 pixels width and height ratio.</p><p> The best thing to know about Hero5 Black is addition of two picture modes that were absent in its predecessors. This time you will be able to enjoy wide views with Wide Dynamic Range option that is available for JPG whereas the other amazing feature is RAW image format that use to have .gpr extension in general. You can easily apply post processing techniques over Still Photos to avail better results.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Video Stabilization:</strong></li></ol><p> Another important feature is it’s in camera type video stabilization that is present like a headline feature in both Hero5 Black as well as Hero 4 silver. This feature helps users to record impressive videos even after facing lots of jerks on the way. The latest design of camera is found to be very useful for adventure sports activities.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Audio Quality:</strong></li></ol><p> Both of these camera units can record audios that are received from external hardware. For Hero5 Black you will also need one USB-C type mic adaptor to make connection. You will be glad to know that the audio quality of latest camera is also improved by so many factors and it can help users to record the stereo audio directly. You can also have a separate audio file collection other than the original video file. The big improvement is that it has ability to generate raw audios that can be later improved by applying some post processing improvement techniques.</p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Voice Controls:</strong></li></ol><p> There use to be so many situations during adventure sports activities when we are not able to hold our camera in hand. For example when we are trekking on a mountain or driving then it is essential to mount camera on a mount that can assist in all way recording. But at this time you cannot use your hands to control different camera actions thus the voice control feature will be highly advantageous for you. You simply need to shout certain commands during recording to assist your camera in basic settings and the intelligent device will keep following you. This feature provides awesome results especially when you are in a low noise condition.</p><ol start="5"><li><strong>GoPro Plus:</strong></li></ol><p> This latest GoPro unit use to have Wi-Fi as well as Bluetooth abilities but the most special feature of this camera is the GoPro Plus compatibility. Users can enjoy the cloud based application to store and share videos capture from GoPro Hero5 Black.

Smartphones are incredibly versatile and</p><p>widely used. Where does that leave the desktop PC, a relic of the 1980s? There are still a ton of options</p><p>available, and the desktop market is constantly innovating, particularly regarding all-in-one and small-</p><p>form-factor devices. But many customers appear to view desktop computers as an antique, since they</p><p>immediately walk to the laptop aisle when making their next computer purchase.</p><p>Let’s start off!</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">MSI MEG Aegis Ti5</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Corsair One i300</a></li><li><a href="#part2-3">Mac Mini (M1, 2020)</a></li><li><a href="#part2-4">Lenovo Yoga A940</a></li><li><a href="#part2-5">Azulle Access4</a></li><li><a href="#part2-6">Alienware Aurora R13</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">How much CPU power do you need</a></li><li><a href="#part4">What graphics card do you need</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-much-does-a-desktop-cost"><a href="#Part-1-How-much-does-a-desktop-cost" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How much does a desktop cost?"></a>Part 1. How much does a desktop cost?</h2><p>The value the desktop offers are among its most attractive claims. With desktop PCs and their components,</p><p>your money just goes further. Instead of spending $600 on a laptop with a capable Intel Core i5 processor, you could spend the same amount of money on a desktop with a Core i7 CPU and perhaps even room for a</p><p>dedicated graphics card.</p><p>For very light labor and display-signage activities, entire micro-PCs are available for about $300, while perfectly functional small towers are available for between $300 and $600. Starting at about $600, gaming desktops with discrete graphics cards are available. All-in-one desktops, which include the display and all of the computer hardware in a single unit, are also available and start at about $450.</p><p>With desktops, you don’t run some of the same risks that you would with a laptop of comparable price. For</p><p>basic computing, a $250 Black Friday deal or a heavily discounted used desktop could work just fine, and you</p><p>wouldn’t have to worry about the cheap materials wearing out the way you could with a laptop of a comparable price. The whims of daily commuting and the sporadic drop from a coffee table would befall that</p><p>cheap laptop. However, the desktop would have to remain stationary and continue to function.</p><p>Business workstations, blinged-out gaming rigs, and exquisitely constructed all-in-one PCs that cost several</p><p>thousand dollars are available at the top of the market. A $3,000 gaming tower will not only provide enormous</p><p>computational capability for today, but it should also have so much room for growth and upgradeability that it will have a considerably longer useful life than any laptop. And that’s before you even explore the wacky world of custom PCs, which includes paint jobs that rival those on automobiles, liquid cooling, and extravagant</p><p>lighting and wiring.</p><p>Business PCs that are IT-manageable and security-conscious—the majority of which are now produced by Dell, HP, and Lenovo—have their own price dynamics and generally cost more. This is due to their expensive</p><p>warranty or maintenance packages as well as the potential addition of enterprise-specific silicon with a</p><p>manageability or security focus. Sometimes, a portion of the price premium for business desktops reflects the</p><p>PC manufacturer’s promise to keep extra parts and upgrades in stock for that model of computers for a specific amount of time in the future. As a result, IT professionals may rely on being able to maintain a fleet of a specific business machine for that period.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended"><a href="#Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

What desktops are recommended?</h2><p>Choosing a new PC tower might be challenging, but we’ve outlined the top models for each function, from</p><p>gaming powerhouses to small PCs for your home office. You may use this list to locate the finest PC to meet</p><p>your demands, whether you’re a student, a busy professional, or an avid gamer.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975555">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975555.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975555">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975555.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975555%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975555/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-MSI-MEG-Aegis-Ti5"><a href="#1-MSI-MEG-Aegis-Ti5" class="headerlink" title="1. MSI MEG Aegis Ti5"></a>1. MSI MEG Aegis Ti5</h3><p>Even so, there are times when you just want the best of the best, the absolute cream of the crop. It won’t be</p><p>for everyone, of course. That, in our opinion, is the MSI MEG Aegis Ti5: a jaw-droppingly distinctive gaming PC with an almost absurdly powerful hardware setup. The front of the computer features a “Gamer Dial” that can be used to adjust system performance settings and display data or amusing animations on a tiny circular</p><p>display.</p><p>The MEG Aegis Ti5 is available in several versions, all of which have the newest gaming hardware. The</p><p>most recent top-spec setup uses an Nvidia RTX 3090 graphics card and an ultra-modern Intel Core i9-12900K</p><p>CPU, but there are many other variants available if that isn’t precisely what you’re looking for. Of course, the</p><p>majority of these models will set you back a good coin, but if performance is what you’re after, look no further.</p><h3 id="2-Corsair-One-i300"><a href="#2-Corsair-One-i300" class="headerlink" title="2. Corsair One i300"></a>2. Corsair One i300</h3><p>The Corsair One i300 is a brilliantly little workstation computer with top-tier performance in a footprint that is barely any larger than the Lenovo IdeaCentre Mini 5i, which is found higher on this list. It is a genuinely</p><p>innovative bit of computer hardware architecture. Due to its single fan positioned on the roof and perforated</p><p>side panels, it also operates more quietly than many powerful PCs.</p><p>Given its high-end internal components and expensive starting price, the One i300 is probably a little overkill</p><p>for the ordinary user. However, there is no doubt that this is the most potent small form factor PC currently on the market, and Corsair provides a choice of variants with AMD and Intel processors.</p><p>This is a great option if you’re searching for a high-end PC for resource-intensive content creation jobs or 4K</p><p>gaming (or both!). Fortunately, the hardware on offer here means that the Corsair One i300 should serve you</p><p>for years to come even though the extremely compact design makes it difficult, if not impossible, to pry open</p><p>the chassis to replace your components.</p><h3 id="3-Mac-Mini-M1-2020"><a href="#3-Mac-Mini-M1-2020" class="headerlink" title="3. Mac Mini (M1, 2020)"></a>3. Mac Mini (M1, 2020)</h3><p>The arrival of the Apple M1 chip meant new Mac hardware across the board, and naturally this included a</p><p>much-needed update to the smallest Apple computer: the Mac Mini. The 2020 M1 edition of this pint-sized</p><p>(Well, it’s actually smaller than a pint) Mac is more powerful than ever, with the new processor offering solid</p><p>performance in video editing, digital art, and even iOS gaming thanks to the new chip.</p><p>Despite this, it’s still Apple’s cheapest Mac ever, with the base model starting at $700 for 8GB of RAM and a</p><p>256GB drive. Budget-conscious Apple fans looking for the best computer need look no further; this is the</p><p>definitive version of the Mac Mini. It retains the same clean design as its predecessors, with a decent selection</p><p>of ports on the rear edge and a thick rubber base that keeps it from sliding around on your desk. The only</p><p>significant downside of the new model is that it can no longer use external GPUs, which could limit its potential</p><p>for users looking to run demanding graphics-intensive software.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105870/7443" target="_top" id="2105870">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105870" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105870/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Lenovo-Yoga-A940"><a href="#4-Lenovo-Yoga-A940" class="headerlink" title="4. Lenovo Yoga A940"></a>4. Lenovo Yoga A940</h3><p>For digital artists, the Lenovo Yoga A940 is without a doubt the best desktop computer available. This feature - rich all-in-one PC from Lenovo is the company’s response to the iMac and is guaranteed to pique the interest of creative types. A magnificent 27-inch 4K display with outstanding contrast and color richness, a strong 25- degree rotating hinge, and a smart stylus are all included.</p><p>The included “content creation dial,” a clever addition that offers tactile control to a number of activities, such</p><p>as zooming in and out on a virtual canvas or scrolling across pages, may be plugged in on either side of the</p><p>screen. On the base of the device, there is also an LED light array and a wireless phone charging pad.</p><p>In general, the Yoga A940 outperforms sleek all-in-one laptops like the Apple iMac and Surface Studio 2, both of which choose clean, simple designs over cramming in exciting features like Lenovo has. Naturally, a mouse and keyboard are provided, though you might wish to update as they are a rather common set. The only significant drawback is the Yoga A940’s somewhat outdated internal components, which prevent it from</p><p>handling intensive tasks like 4K video editing.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044583/7443" target="_top" id="2044583">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044583" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044583/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Azulle-Access4"><a href="#5-Azulle-Access4" class="headerlink" title="5. Azulle Access4"></a>5. Azulle Access4</h3><p>A stick PC can be the best option if you’re constantly on the road and would prefer not to lug along a heavy</p><p>laptop. These tiny computers, often known as “compute sticks,” are made to be plugged into a screen and used right away, making them ideal for professionals who work quickly. The Azulle Access4 may resemble a large flash drive more than a computer, but it can be hooked into any monitor with an HDMI port to turn it into a fully functional Windows or Linux PC.</p><p>The Access4 is simple to use and well-equipped for fundamental tasks like word processing or maintaining</p><p>spreadsheets thanks to its 4GB of RAM and Intel Celeron processor. Since there are no fans, it won’t even emit a whisper of noise and is small enough to put in your jacket pocket. For office workers who may have switched to a “hotdesking” environment, Azulle even sells a Zoom-oriented version that can transform any screen and webcam into an instant videoconferencing tool.</p><h3 id="6-Alienware-Aurora-R13"><a href="#6-Alienware-Aurora-R13" class="headerlink" title="6. Alienware Aurora R13"></a>6. Alienware Aurora R13</h3><p>Since so much of Alienware’s business is focused on making you a PC with the particular components you</p><p>desire, a judgment of the Aurora R13 is largely a judgment of the new Legend 2.0 chassis. And we can confirm</p><p>that the Aurora R13’s new appearance is a hit after working, playing, and tinkering with our review device for a few weeks.</p><p>Even after playing in 4K for hours, the redesigned chassis is simple to access, has lots of ports, and has enough</p><p>ventilation that I didn’t detect much more than a gentle hum and a pleasant warmth coming from the PC. The computer is a bit heavy to move about (mind those fins) or set down on a desk because it can weigh up to 35 pounds. However, if your desk has room for it, the futuristic style and programmable RGB lighting are sure to draw attention.</p><p>If you can afford it, Alienware will outfit the Aurora R13 with premium parts to turn it into a top-notch gaming</p><p>computer. Our review device is not cheap, costing close to $3,000, but it has the capacity to play today’s top</p><p>games in 1080p for years to come. Just be aware that you shouldn’t anticipate getting 4K framerates that are</p><p>lightning quick for that price; the Aurora R13 becomes just as pricey as the other PCs on our list when outfitted</p><p>with premium components.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-much-CPU-power-do-you-need"><a href="#Part-3-How-much-CPU-power-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How much CPU power do you need?"></a>Part 3. How much CPU power do you need?</h2><p>A desktop tower’s utilization of a desktop-grade CPU is one of its key advantages. It may seem simple, but that is a crucial distinction.</p><p>The two largest PC processor manufacturers, AMD and Intel, provide desktop-class chips and laptop-class chips to system builders, although frequently the CPU model names are identical and difficult to distinguish. For instance, you can find Intel’s Core i7 in both laptops and desktops, but a “real” desktop CPU as opposed to one designed for a mobile device performs far better.</p><p>For challenging content creation tasks, PC gaming, or math and science projects, a desktop CPU gives you</p><p>additional power. Software developed to take advantage of the extra cores will profit from faster processors</p><p>with four, six, eight, or perhaps as many as 18 cores. In comparison to variants created for laptops, which must</p><p>be integrated into surroundings with less thermal and power-delivery leeway, the desktop version of a given</p><p>CPU will use more energy and produce more heat. The ability to multithread, which enables each of the CPU’s</p><p>cores to address two processing threads simultaneously rather of just one, is another important feature that</p><p>can be more easily included into a desktop CPU. When used with appropriate software, multithreading,</p><p>sometimes known as “Hyper-Threading” by Intel, can significantly improve performance.</p><p>High-end towers with enough of interior room are the only ones that can accommodate liquid cooling systems, which are only necessary for the very highest-end desktop CPUs. These are very specialized and expensive processors, so you should only use them if you have extremely particular software requirements that you are certain can take use of their higher base and peak clock rates as well as all of their addressable cores and threads. These are not only random purchases.</p><p>Contrarily, many AIOs and tiny PCs employ the same effective, cooler-running CPU designs as you may find in laptops.

How much does a desktop cost?<p>The value the desktop offers are among its most attractive claims. With desktop PCs and their components,</p><p>your money just goes further. Instead of spending $600 on a laptop with a capable Intel Core i5 processor, you could spend the same amount of money on a desktop with a Core i7 CPU and perhaps even room for a</p><p>dedicated graphics card.</p><p>For very light labor and display-signage activities, entire micro-PCs are available for about $300, while perfectly functional small towers are available for between $300 and $600. Starting at about $600, gaming desktops with discrete graphics cards are available. All-in-one desktops, which include the display and all of the computer hardware in a single unit, are also available and start at about $450.</p><p>With desktops, you don’t run some of the same risks that you would with a laptop of comparable price. For</p><p>basic computing, a $250 Black Friday deal or a heavily discounted used desktop could work just fine, and you</p><p>wouldn’t have to worry about the cheap materials wearing out the way you could with a laptop of a comparable price. The whims of daily commuting and the sporadic drop from a coffee table would befall that</p><p>cheap laptop. However, the desktop would have to remain stationary and continue to function.</p><p>Business workstations, blinged-out gaming rigs, and exquisitely constructed all-in-one PCs that cost several</p><p>thousand dollars are available at the top of the market. A $3,000 gaming tower will not only provide enormous</p><p>computational capability for today, but it should also have so much room for growth and upgradeability that it will have a considerably longer useful life than any laptop. And that’s before you even explore the wacky world of custom PCs, which includes paint jobs that rival those on automobiles, liquid cooling, and extravagant</p><p>lighting and wiring.</p><p>Business PCs that are IT-manageable and security-conscious—the majority of which are now produced by Dell, HP, and Lenovo—have their own price dynamics and generally cost more. This is due to their expensive</p><p>warranty or maintenance packages as well as the potential addition of enterprise-specific silicon with a</p><p>manageability or security focus. Sometimes, a portion of the price premium for business desktops reflects the</p><p>PC manufacturer’s promise to keep extra parts and upgrades in stock for that model of computers for a specific amount of time in the future. As a result, IT professionals may rely on being able to maintain a fleet of a specific business machine for that period.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-desktops-are-recommended-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

That, in our opinion, is the MSI MEG Aegis Ti5: a jaw-droppingly distinctive gaming PC with an almost absurdly powerful hardware setup. The front of the computer features a “Gamer Dial” that can be used to adjust system performance settings and display data or amusing animations on a tiny circular</p><p>display.</p><p>The MEG Aegis Ti5 is available in several versions, all of which have the newest gaming hardware. The</p><p>most recent top-spec setup uses an Nvidia RTX 3090 graphics card and an ultra-modern Intel Core i9-12900K</p><p>CPU, but there are many other variants available if that isn’t precisely what you’re looking for. Of course, the</p><p>majority of these models will set you back a good coin, but if performance is what you’re after, look no further.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/352555/5172" target="_top" id="352555">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-352555" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/352555/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Corsair-One-i300-1"><a href="#2-Corsair-One-i300-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Corsair One i300"></a>2. Corsair One i300</h3><p>The Corsair One i300 is a brilliantly little workstation computer with top-tier performance in a footprint that is barely any larger than the Lenovo IdeaCentre Mini 5i, which is found higher on this list. It is a genuinely</p><p>innovative bit of computer hardware architecture. Due to its single fan positioned on the roof and perforated</p><p>side panels, it also operates more quietly than many powerful PCs.</p><p>Given its high-end internal components and expensive starting price, the One i300 is probably a little overkill</p><p>for the ordinary user. However, there is no doubt that this is the most potent small form factor PC currently on the market, and Corsair provides a choice of variants with AMD and Intel processors.</p><p>This is a great option if you’re searching for a high-end PC for resource-intensive content creation jobs or 4K</p><p>gaming (or both!). Fortunately, the hardware on offer here means that the Corsair One i300 should serve you</p><p>for years to come even though the extremely compact design makes it difficult, if not impossible, to pry open</p><p>the chassis to replace your components.</p><h3 id="3-Mac-Mini-M1-2020-1"><a href="#3-Mac-Mini-M1-2020-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Mac Mini (M1, 2020)"></a>3. Mac Mini (M1, 2020)</h3><p>The arrival of the Apple M1 chip meant new Mac hardware across the board, and naturally this included a</p><p>much-needed update to the smallest Apple computer: the Mac Mini. The 2020 M1 edition of this pint-sized</p><p>(Well, it’s actually smaller than a pint) Mac is more powerful than ever, with the new processor offering solid</p><p>performance in video editing, digital art, and even iOS gaming thanks to the new chip.</p><p>Despite this, it’s still Apple’s cheapest Mac ever, with the base model starting at $700 for 8GB of RAM and a</p><p>256GB drive. Budget-conscious Apple fans looking for the best computer need look no further; this is the</p><p>definitive version of the Mac Mini. It retains the same clean design as its predecessors, with a decent selection</p><p>of ports on the rear edge and a thick rubber base that keeps it from sliding around on your desk. The only</p><p>significant downside of the new model is that it can no longer use external GPUs, which could limit its potential</p><p>for users looking to run demanding graphics-intensive software.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868586/19272" target="_top" id="1868586">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868586" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868586/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Lenovo-Yoga-A940-1"><a href="#4-Lenovo-Yoga-A940-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Lenovo Yoga A940"></a>4. Lenovo Yoga A940</h3><p>For digital artists, the Lenovo Yoga A940 is without a doubt the best desktop computer available. This feature - rich all-in-one PC from Lenovo is the company’s response to the iMac and is guaranteed to pique the interest of creative types. A magnificent 27-inch 4K display with outstanding contrast and color richness, a strong 25- degree rotating hinge, and a smart stylus are all included.</p><p>The included “content creation dial,” a clever addition that offers tactile control to a number of activities, such</p><p>as zooming in and out on a virtual canvas or scrolling across pages, may be plugged in on either side of the</p><p>screen. On the base of the device, there is also an LED light array and a wireless phone charging pad.</p><p>In general, the Yoga A940 outperforms sleek all-in-one laptops like the Apple iMac and Surface Studio 2, both of which choose clean, simple designs over cramming in exciting features like Lenovo has. Naturally, a mouse and keyboard are provided, though you might wish to update as they are a rather common set. The only significant drawback is the Yoga A940’s somewhat outdated internal components, which prevent it from</p><p>handling intensive tasks like 4K video editing.</p><h3 id="5-Azulle-Access4-1"><a href="#5-Azulle-Access4-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Azulle Access4"></a>5. Azulle Access4</h3><p>A stick PC can be the best option if you’re constantly on the road and would prefer not to lug along a heavy</p><p>laptop. These tiny computers, often known as “compute sticks,” are made to be plugged into a screen and used right away, making them ideal for professionals who work quickly. The Azulle Access4 may resemble a large flash drive more than a computer, but it can be hooked into any monitor with an HDMI port to turn it into a fully functional Windows or Linux PC.</p><p>The Access4 is simple to use and well-equipped for fundamental tasks like word processing or maintaining</p><p>spreadsheets thanks to its 4GB of RAM and Intel Celeron processor. Since there are no fans, it won’t even emit a whisper of noise and is small enough to put in your jacket pocket. For office workers who may have switched to a “hotdesking” environment, Azulle even sells a Zoom-oriented version that can transform any screen and webcam into an instant videoconferencing tool.</p><h3 id="6-Alienware-Aurora-R13-1"><a href="#6-Alienware-Aurora-R13-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Alienware Aurora R13"></a>6. Alienware Aurora R13</h3><p>Since so much of Alienware’s business is focused on making you a PC with the particular components you</p><p>desire, a judgment of the Aurora R13 is largely a judgment of the new Legend 2.0 chassis. And we can confirm</p><p>that the Aurora R13’s new appearance is a hit after working, playing, and tinkering with our review device for a few weeks.</p><p>Even after playing in 4K for hours, the redesigned chassis is simple to access, has lots of ports, and has enough</p><p>ventilation that I didn’t detect much more than a gentle hum and a pleasant warmth coming from the PC. The computer is a bit heavy to move about (mind those fins) or set down on a desk because it can weigh up to 35 pounds. However, if your desk has room for it, the futuristic style and programmable RGB lighting are sure to draw attention.</p><p>If you can afford it, Alienware will outfit the Aurora R13 with premium parts to turn it into a top-notch gaming</p><p>computer. Our review device is not cheap, costing close to $3,000, but it has the capacity to play today’s top</p><p>games in 1080p for years to come. Just be aware that you shouldn’t anticipate getting 4K framerates that are</p><p>lightning quick for that price; the Aurora R13 becomes just as pricey as the other PCs on our list when outfitted</p><p>with premium components.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-much-CPU-power-do-you-need-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-much-CPU-power-do-you-need-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How much CPU power do you need?"></a>Part 3. How much CPU power do you need?</h2><p>A desktop tower’s utilization of a desktop-grade CPU is one of its key advantages. It may seem simple, but that is a crucial distinction.</p><p>The two largest PC processor manufacturers, AMD and Intel, provide desktop-class chips and laptop-class chips to system builders, although frequently the CPU model names are identical and difficult to distinguish. For instance, you can find Intel’s Core i7 in both laptops and desktops, but a “real” desktop CPU as opposed to one designed for a mobile device performs far better.</p><p>For challenging content creation tasks, PC gaming, or math and science projects, a desktop CPU gives you</p><p>additional power. Software developed to take advantage of the extra cores will profit from faster processors</p><p>with four, six, eight, or perhaps as many as 18 cores. In comparison to variants created for laptops, which must</p><p>be integrated into surroundings with less thermal and power-delivery leeway, the desktop version of a given</p><p>CPU will use more energy and produce more heat. The ability to multithread, which enables each of the CPU’s</p><p>cores to address two processing threads simultaneously rather of just one, is another important feature that</p><p>can be more easily included into a desktop CPU. When used with appropriate software, multithreading,</p><p>sometimes known as “Hyper-Threading” by Intel, can significantly improve performance.</p><p>High-end towers with enough of interior room are the only ones that can accommodate liquid cooling systems, which are only necessary for the very highest-end desktop CPUs. These are very specialized and expensive processors, so you should only use them if you have extremely particular software requirements that you are certain can take use of their higher base and peak clock rates as well as all of their addressable cores and threads. These are not only random purchases.</p><p>Contrarily, many AIOs and tiny PCs employ the same effective, cooler-running CPU designs as you may find in laptops. While most desktop chips have a “T” or “K” or simply a zero at the end, Intel often marks their mobile- first chip designs with a CPU name that contains “U,” “H,” or “P.” Despite having the same number of</p><p>processing cores as its desktop equivalent (four- and six-core CPUs are also frequently found in both), a mobile CPU’s maximum power consumption is frequently much lower.

The resources utilized to express a story and convey a message include films, photography, animation, and music. These stories may distribute more widely and swiftly than ever through online platforms like webpages, journals, and social media sharing sites.</p><p><strong><em>“Simply put, it is telling stories with digital technologies.

Development of Digital Storytelling"></a>Part II. Development of Digital Storytelling</h2><p>Dana Atchley and Joe Lambert of the Center for Digital Storytelling started the digital storytelling advancement in 1994 by teaching others how to create digital stories. Although the power of storytelling has existed for thousands of years, it has only recently become possible for storytellers to <strong>“become digital”</strong> because of the advancement of personal computers and friendly modern communications.</p><p>High goals and outdated technologies coexisted throughout this period. Browsers were quite straightforward at the time, and dial-up remained still in use. There were no devices for accessing the internet, and most individuals read the digital narrative on their desktop computers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/tools-and-tips-virtual-storytelling-2.jpg"                      alt="tools and tips for virtual storytelling"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2112007/7443" target="_top" id="2112007">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2112007" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2112007/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>In this regard, the Center for Digital Storytelling developed a digital story that emphasized first-person narratives that framed memories as potent stories using visuals, audio, and music.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Ignite-Your-Brand’s-Success-with-a-10-Step-Blueprint-for-SMM-Dominance"><a href="#Ignite-Your-Brand’s-Success-with-a-10-Step-Blueprint-for-SMM-Dominance" class="headerlink" title="Ignite Your Brand’s Success with a 10-Step Blueprint for SMM Dominance"></a>Ignite Your Brand’s Success with a 10-Step Blueprint for SMM Dominance</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-1.jpg"                      alt="introduction"                ></p><p>Within the world of social media marketing, there are many different strategies. All of these options can make it easy to feel overwhelmed.</p><p>But don’t worry! We’ve got some tried-and-true tips that can help you get started on your SMM journey.</p><h2 id="What-is-social-media-marketing-SMM"><a href="#What-is-social-media-marketing-SMM" class="headerlink" title="What is social media marketing (SMM)?"></a>What is social media marketing (SMM)?</h2><p>Social media marketing (SMM) typically refers to the use of online communities, social networks, and Internet media collaboration platforms to achieve marketing conversion through various methods, such as media promotion, attracting new users, and maintaining customer relationships.</p><p>Social media marketing, a key battleground for new media marketing, has also provided new impetus to companies involved in traditional marketing and a boost in marketing behavior.</p><p>So, how does a successful social media marketing campaign get planned and executed? Take a look at the ten ideas below.</p><p><strong>1. Design Your Strategies</strong></p><p>You need to follow several steps to become a successful SMM. First, define your goals and objectives. Doing this will determine what kind of content you need and if it is likely to help you reach your goals.</p><p>After defining your goals and objectives, brainstorm some ideas for content that aligns with these objectives. Then set a schedule for creating this content so it can be published on time—and ensure it’s consistent!</p><p>Next up: define your target audience so that every piece of content resonates with this audience—it should also be aligned with their values&#x2F;beliefs&#x2F;needs&#x2F;desires (whatever they may be).</p><p>Once these things are decided, develop strategies for each social media platform based on the type of information shared (i.e., text vs. photo vs. gif vs. video).</p><p><strong>2. Starting Live Broadcast</strong></p><p>Because it allows you to connect with your audience in real time, live streaming is one of the most popular social media marketing tools. It will allow them to interact with you and become involved in your business.</p><p>If done, live streaming can be a good way to increase brand awareness, build trust and improve customer service for your target audience.</p><p>What You’ll Need:</p><ul><li>A camera or phone that supports live streaming (or a laptop) - You can use any device with a camera built-in or connected via a USB cable (webcam). A phone will work, too, if it supports live streaming through its camera app.</li><li>When using a laptop, ensure there’s no glare from windows or lights behind you; otherwise, this could mess up how well people can see what’s happening on screen when watching via computer&#x2F;laptop screen-sharing software such as Skype or Beamr (see below).</li></ul><p><strong>3. Social Media Influencer</strong></p><p>Social media influencer is a term used to describe a person who significantly impacts consumers’ purchasing decisions.</p><p>Influencers can be celebrities and well-known public figures, but they can also be regular people with large followers and engagement on social media.</p><p>Influencers can be paid or unpaid, but most receive compensation for their posts&#x2F;content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-2.jpg"                      alt="social media influencer"                ></p><p><strong>4. Create Subscription Options</strong></p><p>Subscription options are one of the best features of social media marketing. People who subscribe to your channel will be notified via email about all new posts you make on that channel. The subscriber can then choose to accept or decline the notification.</p><p>To create a subscription option:</p><ul><li>Navigate to “Customize” on the top right corner of your page and select “Subscription Options” from the dropdown menu.</li><li>Enter your desired name and description, then click “Save Changes” at the bottom of this section</li><li>To set up a subscription:</li></ul><p><strong>5. Engage with your Audience</strong></p><p>Engaging with your audience is a great way to keep them coming back and to ensure that your content is relevant. Here are some ways you can engage with your audience:</p><ul><li>Respond to comments in real-time. Responding to comments on social media is a great way to get immediate feedback from your community, show them that they’re being heard, and start discussions around topics they care about.</li><li>Answer questions in the comments section of your posts or videos.</li><li>Ask for feedback on new products or services you are launching. This can be as simple as asking what customers want you to create next!</li></ul><p><strong>6. Create User Generated Content</strong></p><p>It’s important to remember that social media is about the community, so it’s important to encourage your audience members to create content.</p><p>If you’re not getting user-generated content (UGC) on your website or blog, you’re losing out on a lot of potential traffic and engagement. Luckily, there are plenty of ways you can make sure that UGC happens:</p><ul><li>Encourage your followers to share images that relate to your brand or products using hashtags such as #yourbrandname and #yourproductsname. This will help people find those posts later when searching for related content.</li><li>If someone posts something valuable on your platforms (Twitter, Instagram), comment and thank them for their contribution! It shows appreciation for their time and effort in creating something useful for others.</li></ul><p><strong>7. Create a Positive Brand Image</strong></p><p>Create a positive brand image. The first thing you want to do is create a positive brand image for yourself and your company. This will help you stand out from the competition and set yourself up for success in all areas of social marketing, especially on social media, where people constantly look for new products or services to try out.</p><p>Use the right words and images. The best way to convey this is through your website’s design, which should be clean, easy to navigate (especially on mobile), simple in style, but modern enough that it looks good with everything else being made today.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/become-a-successful-smm-in-10-steps-3.jpg"                      alt="create a positive brand image"                ></p><p>It’s a good idea to choose a domain name that matches your business name precisely, so there’s no confusion when people visit it online. Or you could go for something generic but memorable like.</p><p><strong>8. Create a Content Plan for your Brand</strong></p><p>The first step in creating a successful SMM strategy is to create a content plan. You can create a content calendar to help you stay on track and be more efficient in your efforts.</p><p>Content planning is important for SMM because it will help you stay focused on what needs to be done, how much time each task takes, and who should do it. The result of having a sound content plan will be an increase in productivity and efficiency while also allowing you to stay on track with your goals.</p><p><strong>9. Keep an Eye on Competition and Trends</strong></p><p>Monitor your competitors and be aware of what is happening in the industry. Take advantage of social media to keep up with industry trends and find out what your audience is interested in. Social media can also help you determine what your competition is doing.</p><p><strong>10. Participate in Social Media Events</strong></p><p>Social media events can be a great way to get your name out there and promote your brand.</p><ul><li>They are a good way to get new leads.</li><li>You can also use social media events to build your brand’s reputation.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123730/7443" target="_top" id="2123730">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123730" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123730/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="BONUS-Just-keep-sending-out-a-message"><a href="#BONUS-Just-keep-sending-out-a-message" class="headerlink" title="BONUS: Just keep sending out a message"></a>BONUS: Just keep sending out a message</h2><p>One of the most important things to remember is that consistency is the key.
