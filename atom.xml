Based on your feasibility and the type of show, it can be detailed or include the essential things. However, the majority of podcast scripts adhere to the following basic format.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-write-podcast-script-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast script"                ></p><h3 id="Intro"><a href="#Intro" class="headerlink" title="Intro"></a>Intro</h3><p>The intro is supposed to build the audience’s interest as soon as they start listening to the podcast. So here, you will warmly welcome your listeners, say some icebreaker sentences, give your intro, and state teaser lines about the podcast.</p><p>*Pro tip: Don’t reveal everything; keep it a little mysterious to hook listeners till the end.</p><h3 id="Guest-intro"><a href="#Guest-intro" class="headerlink" title="Guest intro"></a>Guest intro</h3><p>The guest introduction is crucial because people listen attentively if an expert addresses the topic. So, courteously welcome your guest, and mention his name, profession, achievements, and background (if related to the topic).</p><h3 id="Sponsor-message"><a href="#Sponsor-message" class="headerlink" title="Sponsor message"></a>Sponsor message</h3><p>Every brand has a distinct set of preferences; sometimes, they give you a script that you have to follow word for word, and other times they leave it up to you. In either case, the sponsor messaging should look natural and blend with the layout of your show. Besides, a persuasive sponsor message script will motivate listeners to buy brand products, thereby boosting your number of sponsors—a win-win situation.</p><h3 id="Segue"><a href="#Segue" class="headerlink" title="Segue"></a>Segue</h3><p>When there are multiple segments in an episode, transitions make switching from one to the next seamless. For example, it may be a piece of music, a phrase, motion graphics, etc.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118305/7443" target="_top" id="2118305">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118305" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118305/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>It’s challenging to retain everything after listening to a significant amount of information.

First, having a podcast script will simplify things for you and your guest, as you’ll know the next point already; otherwise, you will make a mess.</p><p>Averting unnecessary gaps and saving time requires planning the segment order and making a list of the main points to discuss. The script ensures you stay on topic and organized to keep listeners interested. A well-planned podcast also requires less effort in post-production. So if you want a streamlined recording experience, take your time and craft a top-notch podcast script.</p><h2 id="Podcast-Script-Outline-Templates"><a href="#Podcast-Script-Outline-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Podcast Script Outline Templates"></a>Podcast Script Outline Templates</h2><p>As promised, it’s time to introduce you to the three most common podcast script templates.

But don’t worry, as we are going to reveal some pro tips to nail your podcast script without much effort.</p><h3 id="How-do-I-write-my-first-podcast"><a href="#How-do-I-write-my-first-podcast" class="headerlink" title="How do I write my first podcast?"></a>How do I write my first podcast?</h3><p>Writing your first podcast script can be challenging, there’s no doubt about it, but if you keep the following ideas in mind while writing, you can produce a good one.</p><p><strong>(1) Avoid saying, ‘Subscribe or follow wherever you get your podcasts!</strong></p><p>The audience should be given a straightforward task, which we have stated many times previously. There is a high likelihood that people will ignore you if you ask them to “Subscribe or follow wherever you get your podcasts” or something similar.</p><p>Make sure to properly guide and simplify the task for the listeners if you want them to fulfill it. The links to other platforms where your podcast is available can be either attached in the notes section or included in the podcast itself.</p><p><strong>(2) Don’t overdo it with CTAs – it’s good to have a range, but stick to one or two per episode.</strong></p><p>Sometimes podcasters get overenthusiastic and stuff each episode with CTAs. That’s insane… Right? Respecting your audience’s time is just as crucial as getting views; failing to do so will result in losing them.</p><p>It’s good to have a range of CTAs, but stick to one or two per episode and try the rest in future episodes. It’s okay to repeat that one or two CTAs a couple of times during the episode to increase the probability that viewers will follow through.</p><p><strong>(3) Mention that it’s free to follow or subscribe</strong></p><p>Along with the CTA message, it’s a good idea to mention that following or subscribing is free. However, people may think they need to pay to subscribe because everything is shifting to a charged model from a free one.</p><p><strong>(4) Know the animating question of your podcast episode, and focus on answering it</strong></p><p>One of the most effective ways to keep the listeners interested throughout the episode is to communicate answers to their questions about that topic. The animating question is that a specific part of your episode answers an existing question. The key to finding the animating questions is “Research,” which will help you focus on the answers listeners want to hear.</p><h2 id="Podcast-script-Hot-FAQs"><a href="#Podcast-script-Hot-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Podcast script Hot FAQs"></a>Podcast script Hot FAQs</h2><p>Sometimes the curiosity of people frightens me.

The device costs around $6200, and it manages to bring in a weight of around 40 pounds. At a speed of 93km&#x2F;h, it’s very fast and it can bring you a 5.2k camera. It’s definitely one of the best drones that can bring you complete aerial photography and a set of resounding features for your money. The manufacturer added multi-rotor features here and the fact that you can easily capture anything with great detail works to your advantage.</p><p> Aside from that, here you have a dual battery design which is rather distinct and you also acquire a very fast acceleration. This means you get to capture the videos you want on the spot and that on its own is rather wonderful to say the least. It’s one of the better professional drones as well, and at this price you can’t really ask for more. Is it worth it? Yes, you do get plenty of value for your money and if you are a professional film maker or photographer, you can make quite a lot of money from it.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> very easy to use and maneuver, fast, 27 minutes of flight time and 5.2k camera</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> expensive and pretty heavy</p><h4 id="2-Best-drone-for-real-estate-use-DJI-Phantom-4"><a href="#2-Best-drone-for-real-estate-use-DJI-Phantom-4" class="headerlink" title="2.

DJI Phantom 4 is offering you full 4K captures and it does a very good job with the flight time which is 28 minutes. At 8.82 pounds, it’s not very heavy and you can maneuver it with is. You can easily save time when you use it, because you can capture the interior footage you want with little to no effort. They did a very good job at bringing a 120 FPS mode. The 12 MP still photos also have a very good quality, which is really what you want to have with this model. The combination of great photos and videos made with this drone show the unique value you can receive from it, so you may want to check it out for that reason alone. Is this a resounding investment? Yes, if you do want a nice quality and great features, you will find that this model does deliver on all of that.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> 4k camera, 28 minutes of flight time, 120 FPS mode</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> It can be too noisy at times</p><h4 id="3-Best-professional-drones-for-agriculture-DJI-Agras-MG-1"><a href="#3-Best-professional-drones-for-agriculture-DJI-Agras-MG-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

You need to make sure that you study the soil and field quality, not to mention you need to assess the health and irrigation of your crops. The DJI Agras MG-1 does a very good job here because its battery lasts for around 24 minutes. It’s a heavy drone at around 8.8 kg, but then again you do have a good and reliable drone that can be monitored and used in any way you want. The liquid tank capacity has around 10 liters and you can use it for spraying as well. They added a smart mode too and the motor is very good at managing battery power. It’s one of the best and most efficient drones out there for agricultural use and the experience you get from using it is very good.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> great features for agricultural use, suitable for spraying crops, great flight time duration</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive (Almost $15000), maneuverability can be better.</p><h4 id="4-Best-professional-drones-for-mapping-and-surveying-3DR-Site-Scan"><a href="#4-Best-professional-drones-for-mapping-and-surveying-3DR-Site-Scan" class="headerlink" title="4.

The price of around $12000 seems rather prohibitive, but the drone is particularly used for taking pictures and it does a very good job at that. It’s very stable and the camera comes with a stabilizer, so each one of the pictures works great and it manages to deliver an incredible value for your money because of that reason alone. You can use the captured images and footage to convert it into 3D models and contour maps if you want.</p><p> It works great for both enterprise and startup use, not to mention that its mapping features are great and to the point. You can charge it for around 1.5 hours, which is a pretty good time for a regular drone.</p><p> Also, you can outline the area that you want to survey on the map and the drone will fly itself. This is a nifty feature and one that many professional drones should start using sooner rather than later.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> You can outline the desired region and make it fly automatically, great image quality, stable and with a great performance.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong>  the price of around $12000 is rather high</p><h4 id="5-Best-drones-for-surveillance-Yuneec-Q500-Typhoon"><a href="#5-Best-drones-for-surveillance-Yuneec-Q500-Typhoon" class="headerlink" title="5.

It’s light at around 1.1kg, not to mention that it costs solely $800, so it’s not an expensive purchase either. Thanks to the 4K video and the 25 minutes of usage, you can easily capture great footage and use it without any problem in a wide variety of situations. The quality you receive is very good and the experience as a whole is a very distinct one. You should consider giving it a try because it does have all the best video capture features out there and it works really well.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> amazing video capture capabilities, great price, lightweight, durable battery</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> controls are a bit iffy at times</p><p> All these professional drones are great for a particular industry.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Unveiling-the-Secrets-of-GoPro-Timelapse-Photography"><a href="#Unveiling-the-Secrets-of-GoPro-Timelapse-Photography" class="headerlink" title="Unveiling the Secrets of GoPro Timelapse Photography"></a>Unveiling the Secrets of GoPro Timelapse Photography</h2><p>GoPro cameras are small and easy to use, you can record video or take photos from almost any angle with one of these cameras. They’re also easy to mount on almost any surface i-e., mounting onto your bike helmet makes it easy to capture every moment on your ride, so that it doesn’t matter where you are, you’ll be able to capture what’s happening around you.</p><p>GoPro time-lapse is a way to view the world from your camera’s point of view. It allows you to see everything that happened in a short period, either as it happens or over several days. You can use GoPro time-lapse to make videos about your daily life, or even about events like weddings, and vacations. You can use GoPro time-lapse for a more serious purpose.</p><p>There are many different cameras available on the market today that will work with GoPro time-lapse. Time-lapse videos are filmed at a constant speed and then edited together to create a video that shows the passage of time in real-time. In this blog post, we’ll explore why GoPro time-lapse is important, and how it can help you capture your memories.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-GoPro-Time-lapse-Video-Mode"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-GoPro-Time-lapse-Video-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is GoPro Time-lapse Video Mode"></a>Part 1: What is GoPro Time-lapse Video Mode</h2><p>GoPro time-lapse video mode allows you to create a video that shows the passage of time over a period of days or weeks. The video is created by taking photos at regular intervals and then editing them together so that they appear to run in real-time. One of the most popular uses of GoPro time-lapse videos is when you want to capture something in motion.</p><p>You can use this technique for many different types of subjects including landscapes, cars, people, and animals and you can even add sounds like birds chirping or waves crashing along with them! It’s also possible to make this type of video if you’re using any other camera brand than GoPro itself. This method produces high-quality videos that can be used as promotional material.</p><p>The GoPro time-lapse creates the final video by stitching together the individual still images into one long clip. The software also allows you to manipulate each frame individually, which can be used to adjust the focus and exposure settings of your shot. GoPro Time-lapse videos are videos that show a sequence of events over a substantial period.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/gopro-timelapse-video-mode.jpg"                      alt="gopro timelapse video mode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-GoPro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-GoPro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with GoPro"></a>Part 2: How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with GoPro</h2><p>If you’re a videographer or photographer, you’ve probably considered shooting time-lapse videos. They’re great for showing the passage of time, but they can also be used to show the beauty of a place. With GoPro cameras, you can create a time-lapse video in just minutes. Here’s how to shoot your time-lapse video with GoPro.</p><h5 id="Step1-Choose-your-shooting-mode"><a href="#Step1-Choose-your-shooting-mode" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Choose your shooting mode"></a>Step1 Choose your shooting mode</h5><p>Firstly, choose the shooting mode, that is which kind of mode you want. If you want to shoot a time-lapse video then first click on the mode button and select the video mode. The video mode will be shown on the front screen after pressing it.</p><h5 id="Step2-Select-the-time-lapse-mode"><a href="#Step2-Select-the-time-lapse-mode" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Select the time-lapse mode"></a>Step2 Select the time-lapse mode</h5><p>Press the set-up button and go to the video settings which are held on the left side. After that click on the time-lapse video. There are many features and options in HERO8. There is a night lapse option in GoPro which is normally used in night photography. We can use this feature when there is limited lighting. The time-lapse mode was used in earlier models.</p><h5 id="Step3-Change-the-interval-settings"><a href="#Step3-Change-the-interval-settings" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Change the interval settings"></a>Step3 Change the interval settings</h5><p>Choosing the correct interval settings is essential to creating a professional-looking time-lapse video. The interval time is the amount of time between each frame in your video. 30 FPS is used by GoPro time-lapse which means 30 pictures are required for a one-second video. The first step to shooting a GoPro time-lapse video is choosing the interval settings.</p><p>This can be done through GoPro’s settings menu, which can be accessed by tapping the icon in the upper right corner of the main screen, then tapping “Settings” in the menu that appears. the camera will take pictures every few seconds while recording video, which is great if you’re trying to hit a certain number of frames per second (FPS).</p><h5 id="Step4-Mount-your-GoPro-and-click-on-the-shutter-button"><a href="#Step4-Mount-your-GoPro-and-click-on-the-shutter-button" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Mount your GoPro and click on the shutter button"></a>Step4 Mount your GoPro and click on the shutter button</h5><p>If you want to shoot time-lapse videos on a GoPro, first you’ll need to mount your camera. Then press the shutter button on your camera and start shooting. Attach the camera to the tripod with the adhesive mount provided. Set up your camera by adjusting the settings for exposure, ISO, and other options in the Settings menu (you can find these settings in the Settings tab)</p><p>You’ll probably want to use a wide-angle lens for this kind of video because you’ll want to capture as much of your surroundings as possible. If you want to change the length of time you want to shoot, press the button again until it says “Time Lapse” or whatever setting you want.</p><h5 id="Step5-Press-the-Shutter-Button-to-End-Shooting"><a href="#Step5-Press-the-Shutter-Button-to-End-Shooting" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Press the Shutter Button to End Shooting"></a>Step5 Press the Shutter Button to End Shooting</h5><p>When you are done with your shooting press the shutter button to end the shooting. GoPro will automatically combine all your clicked photos in a single video. You don’t need to do anything to combine the photos. The best part about this camera is that you can use it to shoot both vertical and horizontal time-lapses, as well as time-lapse photos.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Edit-Time-lapse-Video-on-Computer"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Edit-Time-lapse-Video-on-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Edit Time-lapse Video on Computer"></a>Part 3: How to Edit Time-lapse Video on Computer</h2><p>Editing time-lapse videos can be a bit tricky, but with the right tools and a little bit of practice, you can create some stunning time-lapse videos that will amaze your friends and family.

To use GoPro for time-lapse shooting, simply set up the camera and mount it in a location that will allow it to capture a wide field of view. Once you have collected enough pictures, you can use video editing software to create a time.</p><p>GoPro cameras are ideal for time-lapse photography thanks to their small size, wide field of view, and shooting capabilities. GoPro cameras are an excellent means of documenting a space or event in motion, but the main thing is you always need an editing tool for your photograph so you can choose Filmora software. Filmora is one of the professional tools for editing photos and videos.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-discover-the-secret-to-character-customization-vocal-variety-in-free-fire/"><u>[New] Discover the Secret to Character Customization Vocal Variety in Free Fire</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-from-novice-to-expert-navigating-telegram-web/"><u>[New] In 2024, From Novice to Expert Navigating Telegram Web</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-overcoming-unnatural-motion-blur-in-uav-videos/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Overcoming Unnatural Motion Blur in UAV Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unlocking-full-potential-steam-and-your-switch-pro-controller/"><u>2024 Approved Unlocking Full Potential Steam and Your Switch Pro Controller</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-the-new-era-of-editing-with-powerdirector-24-edition/"><u>In 2024, Mastering the New Era of Editing with PowerDirector '24 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-seamless-methods-for-no-cost-c-span-video-downloads/"><u>In 2024, Seamless Methods for No-Cost C-Span Video Downloads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-complete-guide-to-tecno-spark-20c-frp-bypass-everything-you-need-to-know-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, The Complete Guide to Tecno Spark 20C FRP Bypass Everything You Need to Know</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-15-augmented-reality-games-like-pokemon-go-to-play-on-vivo-y28-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 15 Augmented Reality Games Like Pokémon GO To Play On Vivo Y28 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/podcasts-vs-youtube-which-should-you-choose-in-2024/"><u>Podcasts Vs.

If you think, silhouetted photo is just a dark photo, there’s much more than what you believe. Silhouetting technique has the ability to create a sense of mystery, a special feel as well as captivating shapes and leaves the viewer with a fancy to create and explore the connection with the picture. We are going to provide you some impressive tips for iPhone silhouetting so that your picture will get the same attention what you get when catch the glimpse of silhouette photo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-silhoutte-photo.jpg"                      alt="get-silhoutte-photo"                ></p><p> Image resource: YouTube</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Tips-on-how-to-take-silhouette-photos-with-your-iPhone"><a href="#Tips-on-how-to-take-silhouette-photos-with-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Tips on how to take silhouette photos with your iPhone"></a>Tips on how to take silhouette photos with your iPhone</h2><h3 id="What-makes-a-good-silhouette"><a href="#What-makes-a-good-silhouette" class="headerlink" title="What makes a good silhouette?"></a>What makes a good silhouette?</h3><p> A good silhouette image can really be good when you have some clue about it. First thing to get aware with when going for silhouetted photo is making sure what subject you choose. You should make certain that your subject carries a convincing and recognizable shape. The picture would also be compelling when taken against a setting sun, behind a curtain or sheet. Let us now get the tips and techniques in detail for perfect silhouette photography with your iPhone.</p><h3 id="Tips"><a href="#Tips" class="headerlink" title="Tips"></a>Tips</h3><h4 id="1-Light-Source"><a href="#1-Light-Source" class="headerlink" title="1.  Light Source"></a>1.  Light Source</h4><p> Silhouette photography can be best done when the shot is taken against the source of light. The camera sensor generally fails to interpret the shadow details unlike a human eye. And therefore shooting against the light will help in providing the best silhouette effect. It simply implies keeping the subject against the sunlight or other source of light to get an automatic silhouette and shadowy effect. The most excellent way for emphasized and perfect silhouette photography is ensuring to shoot when there is low sunlight i.e. the time of sunrise and sunset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silouette-agiant-light.jpg"                      alt="silouette-agiant-light"                ></p><p> Image source: Digital Photo Secrets</p><h4 id="2-Low-POV"><a href="#2-Low-POV" class="headerlink" title="2.  Low POV"></a>2.  Low POV</h4><p> A yet another tip for silhouetting effect is capturing the view from a low angle. When you will get down a little lower and capture from a low angle, it will present the picture with a plain and simple background and there will be no clumsiness related to background. The photo taken from low point or by lying down on the ground will result in position changing of the subject and adding more interest to it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silhouette-low-pov.jpg"                      alt="silhouette-low-pov"                ></p><p> Image source: Gettyimages</p><h4 id="3-Lucid-Backgrounds"><a href="#3-Lucid-Backgrounds" class="headerlink" title="3.  Lucid Backgrounds"></a>3.  Lucid Backgrounds</h4><p> Background is one of the chief things to be considered while doing any kind of photography. When you do iPhone silhouette snapping, a mess-free background is what you should take into account. Keeping sky as the background would be perfect choice and the silhouette photography will go perfect when there are clouds in the sky. The subject will acquire a really dramatic effect. Birds and trees are other suggestions for better backdrop of your picture. In short, you should always consider the background when you desire an ideal silhouetted photo. Also, low angle shoot will work here too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silouette-photo-simple-background.jpg"                      alt="silouette-photo-simple-background"                ></p><p> Image source: Pexels</p><h4 id="4-Space-is-Essential"><a href="#4-Space-is-Essential" class="headerlink" title="4.  Space is Essential"></a>4.  Space is Essential</h4><p> A very simple thing to keep in mind while going for silhouette photo moment is leaving enough space when the scene contains several subjects. This is important since it will become difficult to recognize the subject. For example, if there is a family silhouette photo, if you won’t give space, they will be difficult to identify separately in that shadowy effect. However, when shooting stationary subjects and they are very close, ensure a little change in the shooting angle. On the other hand, if shooting moving subjects, do it only when you feel a sufficient space between them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silhouette-photo-space.jpg"                      alt="silhouette-photo-space"                ></p><p> Image source: astro-canada.ca</p><h4 id="5-Ensuring-Accurate-Focus-Exposure"><a href="#5-Ensuring-Accurate-Focus-Exposure" class="headerlink" title="5.  Ensuring Accurate Focus &amp; Exposure"></a>5.  Ensuring Accurate Focus &amp; Exposure</h4><p> When you decide to take an iPhone silhouette photo, please note that iPhone offers a sound exposure that can help creating a pleasing silhouette. The device’s exposure is set automatically to the subject. In case of silhouette photography, it can happen that your subject is relatively large and when the exposure is automatically set to the subject, your silhouette picture can be destroyed ultimately fading the background. Therefore, in this case, you can just tap on the background place which is ideally the brightest part like cloud in the sky. This will in turn give a silhouette effect. Hence, setting focus and exposure accurately is necessary for processing exceptional silhouette photography.</p><h4 id="6-Increase-contrast"><a href="#6-Increase-contrast" class="headerlink" title="6. Increase contrast"></a>6. Increase contrast</h4><p> You can also apply post-production concept to get the remarkable silhouette effect in your snaps. This takes a little moderation in the photography after when you click it. You can use adjustments for a better silhouette effect by adding fair amount of light levels or darkness and highlight your subject. For the adjustments, increasing the contrast would be a recommended option to make the silhouette look darker and brighter. On the other hand, you can use a little amount of vignette effect at the outer range of the photo. This will bring better attention to your subject at the center and will make your silhouette photography moment perfect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silhouette-photo-contrast.jpg"                      alt="silhouette-photo-contrast"                ></p><p> Image source: Flickr</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-from-novice-to-pro-learning-snapseed-essentials/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved From Novice to Pro Learning Snapseed Essentials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-top-tier-psd-artistry-tweaks/"><u>[New] Top-Tier PSD Artistry Tweaks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-techniques-saving-and-recording-ps4-gaming-escapades/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Top Techniques Saving and Recording PS4 Gaming Escapades</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-kickstart-a-successful-charity-contest-via-social-media-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Kickstart a Successful Charity Contest via Social Media for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-unveiling-the-top-7-nft-creators-for-your-artwork-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unveiling the Top 7 NFT Creators for Your Artwork for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-activate-and-use-life360-ghost-mode-on-itel-a60s-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How To Activate and Use Life360 Ghost Mode On Itel A60s | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-sim-pin-code-on-your-poco-x6-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Change Your SIM PIN Code on Your Poco X6 Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-reset-a-motorola-moto-g34-5g-phone-that-is-locked-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Reset a Motorola Moto G34 5G Phone that is Locked?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/pinnacle-10-royale-struggle-games/"><u>Pinnacle 10 Royale Struggle Games</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135414/19272" target="_top" id="2135414">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135414" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135414/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

This article will explain six of the most popular video ideas for YouTube Beauty Gurus.</p><h2 id="Video-Ideas-for-Beauty-Gurus-1"><a href="#Video-Ideas-for-Beauty-Gurus-1" class="headerlink" title="Video Ideas for Beauty Gurus"></a>Video Ideas for Beauty Gurus</h2><h4 id="1-Product-Reviews-and-Tutorials"><a href="#1-Product-Reviews-and-Tutorials" class="headerlink" title="1. Product Reviews and Tutorials"></a>1. Product Reviews and Tutorials</h4><p> A lot of the beauty videos on YouTube feature products, like different types or brands of makeup. Sometimes these videos are reviews where the Beauty Guru explains why they do or do not like a product. These reviews should be about more than whether you like a color (although there is no harm in mentioning that). Think of the questions your viewers might have about products, such as whether they are easy to put on and how long they last for. Tutorials are less about whether you like a product and more about how to use it properly, although most tutorials you do will probably be for products you like.</p><p> Beauty Gurus who start to gain some popularity are sometimes approached by companies about reviews or sponsorships. It is not uncommon for a company to give away free products for Gurus to review, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with accepting these and then reviewing them honestly. You should never let a company pay you for a good review, though. If products could buy their ways into your good graces then your subscribers would not be able to trust you.</p><p> Accepting sponsorship is not the same as being paid for a good review. If a brand sponsors you then you just need to be upfront about it and let your subscribers know. They may, understandably, not put much stock as your positive reviews of your brand’s products or your negative reviews of their competitors. That’s fine. Focus on tutorials and other types of videos. If you are popular enough that a company decided to approach you then your channel must be big enough to survive losing the few subscribers who will not like the idea of you being sponsored.</p><h4 id="2-‘Look’-Tutorials"><a href="#2-‘Look’-Tutorials" class="headerlink" title="2. ‘Look’ Tutorials"></a>2. ‘Look’ Tutorials</h4><p> Do you think you could recreate the red-carpet makeup or hairstyle of a popular celebrity? If you can then that is a great video idea, and you will have as many of these ideas as there are celebrities whose looks you can duplicate. These are the kinds of videos that a lot of viewers on YouTube find interesting. You do not even need to choose real people all of the time. Think about your audience and what kinds of media they might be interested in. Teaching them how to get the same look as a fictional tv or movie character could be a big hit.</p><h4 id="3-Style-by-Occasion"><a href="#3-Style-by-Occasion" class="headerlink" title="3. Style by Occasion"></a>3. Style by Occasion</h4><p> When you know there is a holiday or special occasion coming up then you might want to get a themed video out ahead of it. Showing your subscribers nice styles for a New Year’s Party, or Thanksgiving with the family, can go over really well. These ‘style’ videos do not need to be focused only on seasonal occasions.</p><p> The occasion you teach your subscribers how to dress, do makeup, or style their hair for might be something like school or work. Tips that help people look their best on a daily basis will not only be useful to your subscribers they will show people that beauty is an everyday passion of yours, not just an occasional one. Besides, people are going to be curious about how you usually style yourself.</p><h4 id="4-Favorite-Things"><a href="#4-Favorite-Things" class="headerlink" title="4. Favorite Things"></a>4. Favorite Things</h4><p> People are going to subscribe to you because they think you are knowledgeable, have good taste, and are fun to watch. ‘Favorite Things’ videos demonstrate all of these things. By showing people your favorite products you show them that you know what is out there and what is good. It is also a window into your personal taste. As to being fun to watch; these videos are all about you and what you like. They are a great opportunity to show off your personality.</p><h4 id="5-Problem-Solving"><a href="#5-Problem-Solving" class="headerlink" title="5. Problem Solving"></a>5. Problem Solving</h4><p> You can make videos that will solve real problems your subscribers might have. For example, you can make videos where you teach your subscribers how to manage acne or get stains out of clothes. As people start trusting you as their source of beauty information they may even start asking you questions about problems like these. If you start getting requests for help and do not know how to answer you should do the research and then make a video rather than ignoring the question. Your subscribers will like to see that you care.</p><h4 id="6-Hauls"><a href="#6-Hauls" class="headerlink" title="6. Hauls"></a>6. Hauls</h4><p> After shopping trips you can make quick videos where you show what you bought. This will give your viewers a good idea of your fashion sense. It is also a great way to build up anticipation about what kinds of reviews or tutorials you might have coming up. Haul videos are easy because you do not need to put a lot of planning into them, or even make an outline. You just sit in front of your camera with your shopping bags and start unpacking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-enriching-zoom-video-clarity-essential-tips/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Enriching Zoom Video Clarity Essential Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-insightful-evaluation-androids-photography-tool-lightroom-for-2024/"><u>[New] Insightful Evaluation Android's Photography Tool, Lightroom for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-olympic-thrills-amidst-snowy-bliss-in-beijing-2022/"><u>[New] Olympic Thrills Amidst Snowy Bliss in Beijing 2022</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-quest-for-enchanted-speech-is-the-magic-app-real-uncover-other-pathways/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Quest for Enchanted Speech Is the Magic App Real?

With so much 4K content being released daily, owning a 4K TV or a 4K Blu-ray player is becoming more common and affordable, than just a few years ago. Major movie studios, as well as online streaming companies like Netflix, produce an increasing number of 4K releases each year, but without the technology that enables you to reproduce 4K images in your own home, you won’t be able to enjoy these remarkable movies in their full glory. 4K Blu-ray players are capable of playing UHD 4K, HDR and 3D content and allow its users to watch movie releases such as The Martian or The Fantastic Four at home.</p><p> Needless to say, in order to use your 4K Blu-Ray players, you’ll also need a 4K TV, because no other TV is capable of reproducing the wide color gamut, crystal clear images or true 4K resolution. To make things even better the 4K Blu-ray players and 4K TVs work together as a kind of a picture laboratory that enhances the 1080p image quality supported by standard Blu-ray players and thus reduce the imminent need to replace your movie collection with the latest 4K releases. We have gathered some of the best 4K Blu-ray players in 2017, so far, in order to provide you with all the information, you might need if you are thinking about getting one of these incredible players.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Best-4K-Blu-ray-Players"><a href="#Best-4K-Blu-ray-Players" class="headerlink" title="Best 4K Blu-ray Players"></a>Best 4K Blu-ray Players</h2><p> The first 4K Blu-ray discs and players became available on the market in March 2016 and in a little more than a year the 4K Blu-ray technology has taken the world by storm. In 2017, many of the manufacturers released their new 4K Blu-ray player models that offer even more options and guarantee a superb home entertainment experience. Even though there aren’t that many 4K Blu-Ray players currently available on the market, the overall performance of the available models will leave most people speechless.</p><h4 id="1-Panasonic-DMP-UB700"><a href="#1-Panasonic-DMP-UB700" class="headerlink" title="1. Panasonic DMP-UB700"></a>1. Panasonic DMP-UB700</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/panasonic-dmp-ub700.jpg"                      alt="panasonic dmp-ub700"                ></p><p> Although similar to the Panasonic’s UB900 model the DMP-UB700 has a slick design that will make any room look stylish. Compared to the UB900, the UB700 has fewer connectivity options, but despite the fact that the unit doesn’t feature an analog audio output, it is equipped with two HDMI ports, one for video and one for audio, SD card reader and a USB slot.</p><p> The Panasonic’s 4K Blu-ray player is user-friendly and its menu is extremely easy to use. Music, Video, Home Network, Photos, Network Service and Setup options allow users to choose the mode that best fits their current needs. The UB-700 features a number of apps such as YouTube, BBC News or Netflix that can all be experienced in true 4K resolution. To make things even sweeter the Netflix app is also 4K HDR-enabled, a feature that allows users to watch their favorite shows and movies in the best image quality.</p><p> Depending on your screen the Panasonic DMP-UB700 can output 4K content by interpolating from 10-bit native color to 12-bit with 4:4:4 color subsampling or 8-bit native color with a 4:2:0 subsampling. Via the HDMI auto options the player automatically selects the mode that is best suited for the resolution of the screen, however, users who don’t own a 4K HDR TV need to adjust the settings manually via the Dynamic Range Conversion Circuit.</p><h4 id="2-Oppo-UDP-203"><a href="#2-Oppo-UDP-203" class="headerlink" title="2. Oppo UDP-203"></a>2.

Their elegantly and functionally designed UDP-203 model is perhaps one of the best 4K Blu-ray players in 2017, but it is also one of the most expensive ones. With the approximate market value of $850, the Oppo UDP-203 is one of the 4K Blu-ray players that offer the widest range of options today, but it still lacks built-in online streaming apps as well as HDR on HDMI output.</p><p> The Oppo’s outstanding 4K Blu-ray player is equipped with a number of connectivity options, such as several HDMI 2.0 slots that enable you to add smart features and a few USB 3.0 ports. Besides being able to reproduce 4K and Full HD images in both 2D and 3D the UDP-203 can also play Audio DVDs and AVCHD files, among many other. Its color output is another area in which the UDP-203 is dominant. It features an HDR-10 support accompanied by 8, 10 and 12-bit color that contributes to an overall stunning image quality this 4K Blu-ray player reproduces. The fascinating feature list is enriched by a Dolby Vision HDR support that further extends already impressive capabilities of the UDP-203.</p><h4 id="3-Panasonic-DMP-UB900"><a href="#3-Panasonic-DMP-UB900" class="headerlink" title="3.

The abundance of connectivity options enables the users to play video, audio and photo files through USB or SD card slots, while 7.1 channel audio output guarantees a superb sound quality. The UB900 also features two HDMI slots that can be used for playing image and sound files.</p><p> This 4K Blu-ray player can also play HDR files from discs powered by the 4K High-Precision Chroma processor. Panasonic’s upsampling system improves color accuracy and reduces the color errors by applying the edge adaptive processing. The UB900 features 4K Netflix and 4K YouTube apps that enable the users to stream the high-quality videos and enjoy 4K image quality on their TVs. The Panasonic’s 4K Blu-ray player has a THX certification that guarantees that all colors displayed by this player appear as their creator meant them to be. The amazing sound and image capabilities make the UB900 a great buy that will meet the needs of the most demanding users.</p><h4 id="4-Samsung-UBD-M9500"><a href="#4-Samsung-UBD-M9500" class="headerlink" title="4.

The front of the UBD-M9500 features an OLED display, while at the back there are two HDMI outputs and a LAN port. The Samsung’s 4K player also features WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity options.</p><p> Besides being able to play a disk that carries 4K content, the M9500 can also handle DVDs, HD Blu-rays, or CDs. However, DVD-audio and SACD discs are not compatible with this model. Perhaps the most alluring feature, that isn’t offered by any other rival 4K player, is the Blu-ray to Mobile viewing system. This feature enables the users to wirelessly transmit UHD and HD Blu-ray content from the Samsung UBD M9500 to a Smartphone.</p><p> The highly customizable Eden system provides access to over 300 apps, including streaming services such as Amazon Video, YouTube or Netflix. Each of these apps is available in both 4K and HDR, which means that the videos played through M9500 are always going to meet the highest standards. Despite amazing features, the Panasonic’s 4K Blu-ray player doesn’t offer a 3D support or Dolby Vision HDR support. Be it as it may, it is still one of the best 4K Blu-ray players on the market in 2017.</p><h4 id="5-Panasonic-DMP-UB300"><a href="#5-Panasonic-DMP-UB300" class="headerlink" title="5.

To begin with, this 4K Blu-ray player doesn’t have WiFi support and the only way it can be connected to the Internet is via the LAN connection. The UB300 has only one HDMI output and a single USB 3.0 port which significantly narrows down the connectivity options.</p><p> However, the video playback features compensate for the lack of connectivity options. Equipped with an HDR-10 and the same 4K High Precision Chroma Processor featured on the UB900 model. The users can also choose between 10 and 12-bit color so they can adjust the color settings to best fit the content. The UB300 allows you to choose between several HDR settings such Standard, Natural Environment, Light Environment or Bright Environment and each of these options has a significant impact on the image.</p><p> The Panasonic DMP-UB300 offers a standard package of network services like YouTube, Amazon Video, and Netflix that can all be played in 4K resolution. Even though the UB300 may have its disadvantages, it is still one of the best 4K Blu-ray players today, and the image quality it delivers is simply breathtaking.</p><h4 id="6-Samsung-UBD-K8500"><a href="#6-Samsung-UBD-K8500" class="headerlink" title="6.

The K8500’s recognizable curved design is characteristic of its manufacturer and it fits well with Samsung’s 4K TVs. Besides being a well-built and elegantly designed player, the UDB-K8500 is also a powerful 4K Blu-ray player that delivers stunning images. It offers a number of connectivity options, including two HDMI ports that enable you to separate the video and audio output. Furthermore, the video 2.0 HDMI supports HDR which is a bonus for all users that want nothing but the most accurate colors displayed on their TVs.</p><p> The K8500 has a built-in WiFi connection, but users can also choose to connect the 4K Blu-ray player via an Ethernet port. Samsung’s K8500 model can play a large number of different discs including the standard Blu-ray discs, DVDs or DVD-audio discs. Regardless of the disc, you decide to take for a spin, the K8500 will deliver a remarkable image quality, although it doesn’t support 3D images. The deck offers a wide range of online apps that allow you to access the latest movie releases on Netflix or Amazon Instant Video, while apps like Spotify and Deezer provide you with unlimited access to all genres of music.</p><h4 id="7-LG-UP970"><a href="#7-LG-UP970" class="headerlink" title="7.

The UP970’s design is modern and above everything else functional which makes the set up of this 4K Blu-ray player almost effortless. The UP970 has all the outputs and ports the users might need, including a couple of HDMI outputs that can be used to connect the device even with 4K AV receivers, a single 2.0 USB port and an optical output that enables the connection with a Soundbar.</p><p> The manufacturer made sure that their 4K Blu-ray player is equipped with both Dolby Vision and HDR-10 technologies that support HDR content and ensure that the colors displayed on a 4K TV are accurate. A number of online apps available is somewhat limited, but users can still enjoy streaming services from Netflix and watch 4K content through the Netflix app.</p><p> The LG UP970 is a solid 4K player and certainly, among the very best in its price range because features like 3D TV compatibility and 4K Upscaling make it an attractive option for users who want an affordable and yet powerful 4K Blu-ray player.</p><h4 id="8-Philips-BDP7501"><a href="#8-Philips-BDP7501" class="headerlink" title="8. Philips BDP7501"></a>8. Philips BDP7501</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/philips-bdp7501.jpg"                      alt="philips-bdp7501"                ></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FWKIGFS/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01FWKIGFS&linkId=130d04fe3450e5fc021b0477f51295e5" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> The square design of the Philips BDP7501 distinguishes it from other 4K Blu-ray players that mostly have a rectangular shape. Furthermore, the BDP7501 is equipped with two HDMI outputs, USB, and LAN ports, but a few more audio-out options could improve the connectivity of this 4K Blu-ray player. Also, the SD card slot isn’t an option, so the users can forget about viewing their photos directly from the card. The BDP7501 offers a strong performance in terms of image quality and color range because it is equipped with the HDR-10, 12-bit color, and BT.2020 color space. The Philips’ 4K Blu-ray player supports 3D Blu-ray, standard Blu-ray, DVDs, and CDs, but it cannot play SACD or DVD-audio discs. All things considered, the BDP7501 offers a solid all-around performance and even though it could have more options it is far from being an underwhelming 4K Blu-ray player.</p><p> Perhaps the biggest disadvantage of this player is the lack of online apps. The users can only choose between YouTube and Netflix, while the entire OS is stripped of more advanced features. Despite all this, the BDP7501 is still an affordable 4K playback option that is capable of providing 4K image quality to the users who don’t wish to spend a small fortune on a 4K Blu-ray player.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p> Making the decision which 4K Blu-ray player you should buy for your home entertainment setup isn’t an easy decision and there are a few factors that need to be taken into consideration. Depending on your budget and player’s capabilities you should choose the one that best suits your needs. If you want to spend a bit more money but be sure that you have a high-end 4K player we suggest to go for Oppo UDPP-203, even though it doesn’t feature any online apps.</p><p> However, if you’d like to opt for a more affordable and yet equally impressive performer our suggestion would be to chose the Panasonic DMP-UB900, because of the wide array of options and an amazing OS that supports a large number of online apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-iphone-macro-magic-capturing-the-fine-details/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved IPhone Macro Magic Capturing the Fine Details</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/new-avoid-distortion-best-practices-for-shooting-up-close-with-videoleap/"><u>[New] Avoid Distortion Best Practices for Shooting Up Close with VideoLeap</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-optimize-viewing-the-finest-html5-video-solutions-for-2024/"><u>[New] Optimize Viewing The Finest HTML5 Video Solutions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-shoot-hdr-photos-with-iphone/"><u>2024 Approved How to Shoot HDR Photos with iPhone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-cloud.techidaily.com/aerial-shooting-essentials/"><u>Aerial Shooting Essentials</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/complete-guidebook-to-evaluating-your-videos-impact-and-earning-power-for-2024/"><u>Complete Guidebook to Evaluating Your Video's Impact and Earning Power for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/constructing-captivating-podcast-vignettes/"><u>Constructing Captivating Podcast Vignettes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/crafting-captivating-content-for-a-consistent-climb-in-subscribers-for-2024/"><u>Crafting Captivating Content for a Consistent Climb in Subscribers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-guide-to-mirror-your-motorola-moto-g-stylus-5g-2023-to-other-android-devices-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Guide to Mirror Your Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G (2023) to Other Android devices | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-speaker-breakdown-latest-models/"><u>In 2024, Speaker Breakdown Latest Models</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-solutions.techidaily.com/master-the-solution-to-persistent-terraria-game-crashes-edition/"><u>Master the Solution to Persistent Terraria Game Crashes Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/mastering-inshot-pc-editing-made-easy/"><u>Mastering Inshot PC Editing Made Easy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/strategic-advantages-in-business-with-vr-tech-for-2024/"><u>Strategic Advantages in Business with VR Tech for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/the-art-of-discrete-audio-erosion-in-audacity-for-2024/"><u>The Art of Discrete Audio Erosion in Audacity for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/the-stagnation-of-ideas-in-contemporary-vr-for-2024/"><u>The Stagnation of Ideas in Contemporary VR for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137974/21526" target="_top" id="2137974">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137974" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137974/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

After all, a longer flight life means the longer you have to make sure you get your perfect shot (video or still frame,) or are able to more thoroughly inspect whatever it is you are looking to inspect. Basically, at the end of the day a longer flight time directly relates to having more fun.</p><p>While it is true that you can (and should) carry some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >extra batteries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with you while piloting your drone, stopping what you are doing to change batteries out can be a real hassle, and a drain on your productivity.

Thanks to its four foldable arms, this drone is perfect to be packed away to take on exotic shooting locations. However, one of the main features, aside from its size, is the Follow Me feature that this drone comes equipped with. This feature allows the drone to focus in on its uses (thanks to the smart watch controls,) and automatically follow you as you go for a run, walk or even play a little flag football.

So whether you use a laptop or desktop, you can generate text from your voice through your device’s microphone. Officially known as Dictation, the app allows you to transcribe text anywhere you can type it. So, for example, you can use Apple Dictation for your messaging and word processing apps.</p><p>The feature has been available since macOS Sierra as a free built-in feature. Earlier versions of Apple Dictation relied on its own voice recognition software. However, it now relies on Siri for users of macOS Catalina onwards.</p><p>Typically, the app allows you to transcribe thirty seconds and below of audio. However, you can enable Enhanced dictation for longer transcription times. According to most users, the app is suitable for getting the first draft of your assignment, which you can manually edit later.</p><p>Follow these steps to enable Apple Dictation on your Mac:</p><ol><li>Tap the Apple logo on the top-left toolbar of your screen and select <strong>System Preferences</strong> from the resulting menu.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Keyboard</strong> option from the system preferences screen.</li><li>Once there, click on the <strong>Dictation</strong> option located at the top of the menu.</li><li>Select <strong>On</strong> to activate the app in its default mode. In addition, you can check the <strong>Use Enhanced Dictation</strong> box to enable additional functions such as offline use and text commands like bold and italics.</li><li>Finally, select your language from the dropdown menu and choose a shortcut key.</li></ol><p>Please note that you need to speak your punctuations loudly when using Apple Dictation. Otherwise, the app will consider them as regular words.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Top-5-Dragon-for-Mac"><a href="#Part-5-Top-5-Dragon-for-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Top 5 Dragon for Mac"></a>Part 5: Top 5 Dragon for Mac</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/dragon-for-mac-5.jpg"                      alt="top 5 dragon for mac"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118306/7443" target="_top" id="2118306">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118306" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118306/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Dragon Dictate is arguably the best dictation software currently on the market. According to most users, its accuracy and feature sets are next to none. For example, the Smart Format Rules learns how you represent dates, numbers, and abbreviations, resulting in less editing work for you. The Dragon Dictate app is free to download from the Apple Store.</p><p>Dragon for Mac users report a dictation accuracy of nearly 99%, which is excellent in the speech to text software category. All of Nuance’s Dragon products use deep learning technology to capture your accent and cadence. As such, the app gets better at transcribing your text as you continue using it. In addition, dragon for Mac professional allows you to transcribe audio clips from uploaded files. For example, you can import audio from your iPhone to your Dragon Dictate workspace and transcribe it hassle-free.</p><p>Unfortunately, you cannot get a stand-alone dragon app for Mac. This is because Nuance discontinued its development in 2018. In addition, Microsoft’s acquisition of the company in 2021 proves that the decision is permanent. However, you can still use the Windows version of Dragon through Parallels, which allows you to run macOS and Windows simultaneously. In addition, this method also works for M1 Macs.</p><h2 id="Part-6-FAQs"><a href="#Part-6-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: FAQs"></a>Part 6: FAQs</h2><h3 id="Is-there-a-difference-between-voice-recognition-and-speech-to-text"><a href="#Is-there-a-difference-between-voice-recognition-and-speech-to-text" class="headerlink" title="Is there a difference between voice recognition and speech to text?"></a>Is there a difference between voice recognition and speech to text?</h3><p>Voice recognition software allows your device to capture your accent and tone and then stores that data for different functions, such as user logins and speech to text functionality.

So whether you use a laptop or desktop, you can generate text from your voice through your device’s microphone. Officially known as Dictation, the app allows you to transcribe text anywhere you can type it. So, for example, you can use Apple Dictation for your messaging and word processing apps.</p><p>The feature has been available since macOS Sierra as a free built-in feature. Earlier versions of Apple Dictation relied on its own voice recognition software. However, it now relies on Siri for users of macOS Catalina onwards.</p><p>Typically, the app allows you to transcribe thirty seconds and below of audio. However, you can enable Enhanced dictation for longer transcription times. According to most users, the app is suitable for getting the first draft of your assignment, which you can manually edit later.</p><p>Follow these steps to enable Apple Dictation on your Mac:</p><ol><li>Tap the Apple logo on the top-left toolbar of your screen and select <strong>System Preferences</strong> from the resulting menu.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Keyboard</strong> option from the system preferences screen.</li><li>Once there, click on the <strong>Dictation</strong> option located at the top of the menu.</li><li>Select <strong>On</strong> to activate the app in its default mode. In addition, you can check the <strong>Use Enhanced Dictation</strong> box to enable additional functions such as offline use and text commands like bold and italics.</li><li>Finally, select your language from the dropdown menu and choose a shortcut key.</li></ol><p>Please note that you need to speak your punctuations loudly when using Apple Dictation.

According to most users, its accuracy and feature sets are next to none. For example, the Smart Format Rules learns how you represent dates, numbers, and abbreviations, resulting in less editing work for you. The Dragon Dictate app is free to download from the Apple Store.</p><p>Dragon for Mac users report a dictation accuracy of nearly 99%, which is excellent in the speech to text software category. All of Nuance’s Dragon products use deep learning technology to capture your accent and cadence. As such, the app gets better at transcribing your text as you continue using it. In addition, dragon for Mac professional allows you to transcribe audio clips from uploaded files. For example, you can import audio from your iPhone to your Dragon Dictate workspace and transcribe it hassle-free.</p><p>Unfortunately, you cannot get a stand-alone dragon app for Mac. This is because Nuance discontinued its development in 2018. In addition, Microsoft’s acquisition of the company in 2021 proves that the decision is permanent. However, you can still use the Windows version of Dragon through Parallels, which allows you to run macOS and Windows simultaneously. In addition, this method also works for M1 Macs.</p><h2 id="Part-6-FAQs-1"><a href="#Part-6-FAQs-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: FAQs"></a>Part 6: FAQs</h2><h3 id="Is-there-a-difference-between-voice-recognition-and-speech-to-text-1"><a href="#Is-there-a-difference-between-voice-recognition-and-speech-to-text-1" class="headerlink" title="Is there a difference between voice recognition and speech to text?"></a>Is there a difference between voice recognition and speech to text?</h3><p>Voice recognition software allows your device to capture your accent and tone and then stores that data for different functions, such as user logins and speech to text functionality.

It allows you to remove unwanted backgrounds or objects from an image, change its color, or even create a mask. But many users need help using the Background Eraser tool for their pictures.</p><p>To simplify things, we’ll provide basic information about the eraser tools in Photoshop.</p><p>So, if you are ready to learn how to use the Background Eraser tool in Photoshop, let’s dig in!</p><h2 id="Basic-Information-About-Eraser-Tools-In-Photoshop"><a href="#Basic-Information-About-Eraser-Tools-In-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Basic Information About Eraser Tools In Photoshop"></a>Basic Information About Eraser Tools In Photoshop</h2><p>The <strong>eraser tools in Photoshop</strong> can be used to create transparent backgrounds or to remove unwanted background elements from an image. These tools work by sampling the color of the pixels in the image and then erasing pixels that match the sampled color.</p><p>There are three main variations of eraser tools in Photoshop:</p><ul><li>Eraser</li><li>Background Eraser</li><li>Magic Eraser</li></ul><p>Many people need clarification with Photoshop’s Background Eraser and Magic Eraser tools. Therefore, we’ve discussed their similarities and dissimilarities. You can understand them better and so that you can prefer the one that suits your needs:</p><h3 id="Similarities"><a href="#Similarities" class="headerlink" title="Similarities"></a>Similarities</h3><p>The following are the similarities between the Background Eraser and Magic Eraser Tools:</p><p><strong>Erase Pixels Based On Colors:</strong> The Background Eraser tool and Magic Eraser tool can erase pixels based on their color. This means you can select a color, and the tool will erase all the related pixels.</p><p><strong>Destructive Tools:</strong> Both the Background Eraser and Magic Eraser are destructive tools in nature. They delete the pixels you erase. Therefore, you cannot undo or redo your changes once you’ve used either of these tools. However, there are some non-native workarounds to restore your images.</p><h3 id="Dissimilarities"><a href="#Dissimilarities" class="headerlink" title="Dissimilarities"></a>Dissimilarities</h3><p>Here are some dissimilarities between the Background Eraser and Magic Eraser Tools:</p><p><strong>Usage</strong>: To use the Background Eraser tool, you have to hover over the area in your image to erase it based on the pixels you paint over. On the other hand, the Magic Eraser tool instantly erases similar pixels based on your selected color.</p><p><strong>Adjustment Settings</strong>: The Background Eraser offers more adjustment tools than the Magic Eraser. For instance, the former offers Sampling, Limits, Brush size, Tolerance, Angle, and Protect Foreground Color settings, while the latter includes Tolerance, Anto-alias, Contiguous, Sample All Layers, and Opacity options.</p><p>Each tool’s diversity in options significantly affects the final image’s quality. For example, the Magic Eraser Tool erases areas rapidly, though there is limited control over which pixels are deleted.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2135472">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2135472">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2135472.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2135472%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2135472/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Background-Of-Eraser-Tools-Settings-Before-The-Tutorial"><a href="#Background-Of-Eraser-Tools-Settings-Before-The-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Background Of Eraser Tools Settings Before The Tutorial"></a>Background Of Eraser Tools Settings Before The Tutorial</h2><p>Before starting our tutorial on <strong>how to use the Background Eraser tool in Photoshop,</strong> let’s first discuss the adjustment options enabled when selecting the tool and working with them. In this way, you can better understand the steps in the guidance.</p><h3 id="1-Brush-Preset-Picker"><a href="#1-Brush-Preset-Picker" class="headerlink" title="1. Brush Preset Picker"></a>1. Brush Preset Picker</h3><p>When you enable the Background Eraser tool in Photoshop, you will see that the cursor changes to a brush, indicating that this tool works like other <strong>“Brush Tools.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/bruch-preset-picker-function-in-background-eraser-tool.png"                      alt="bruch preset picker function in background eraser tool"                ></p><p>The <strong>Brush Preset Picker</strong> is the first option that opens up a panel to let you adjust the size of your brush, its hardness, spacing, and tolerance. You can also change the size using the <strong>Left Bracket ( [ )</strong> and <strong>Right Bracket ( ] )</strong>  keys on your PC keyboard.</p><p>To adjust the hardness, press the <strong>“Shift+ Left Bracket”</strong> or <strong>“Shift+Right Bracket”</strong> keys. We recommend that you set it to <strong>100%</strong> when erasing the pixels from your image.</p><h3 id="2-Sampling-Options"><a href="#2-Sampling-Options" class="headerlink" title="2. Sampling Options"></a>2. Sampling Options</h3><p>In the Background Eraser tool’s <strong>Options bar,</strong> you will find the <strong>“Sampling Options”</strong> that includes three different icons with different behaviors:</p><p><strong>Continuous</strong>: This option is selected by default and works best on an image with a colorful background because it removes different pixels as you drag your brush around your picture.</p><p><strong>Once</strong>: If your image’s background does not have many colors, this setting will work best. This is because it removes a single pixel at a time.</p><p><strong>Background Swatch</strong>: You may sometimes have difficulty positioning the crosshair tool precisely over the color you wish to erase. To prevent this, you can use the Background Swatch Option that helps you pick a color and will only erase the activated color from the BG.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1328683">                    <video width="200" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328683.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1328683">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328683.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:125px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1328683%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1328683/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Limits"><a href="#3-Limits" class="headerlink" title="3. Limits"></a>3. Limits</h3><p>After you pick a color to erase, the Limits function identifies the location of the pixels that match that color, making it easier for you to erase them precisely.</p><p>The Limit function comes with three options:</p><p><strong>Contiguous:</strong> It’s a default option that erases pixels of the same color touched by the crosshair, which means that it won’t remove any isolated area of pixels located in other image elements.</p><p><strong>Discontiguous:</strong> When you enable the Discontiguous option, Photoshop can erase any pixels in the image that match the sampled color, regardless of whether or not they are touching the crosshair.</p><p><strong>Find Edges:</strong> This setting will come in handy when you find that the edges around your subject are not sharp enough. The Find Edges option works more precisely than the Contiguous and helps to smooth down the sides.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/limits-function-in-background-eraser-tool.png"                      alt="limits function in background eraser tool"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118314/7443" target="_top" id="2118314">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118314" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118314/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Tolerance"><a href="#4-Tolerance" class="headerlink" title="4. Tolerance"></a>4. Tolerance</h3><p>Located directly to the right of the Limits function, Tolerance is one of the most important options in Background Eraser, as it signifies how much a pixel’s shade can vary from the sampled color for Photoshop to erase it.</p><p>By default, the Tolerance’s value is set to <strong>50%</strong>. But you should attempt a lower Tolerance setting if your background color is somewhat similar to the subject and Photoshop erases its parts while removing the background.</p><p>If, however, the background color is fringing around the subject, use a higher Tolerance value.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/tolerance-function-in-background-eraser-tool.png"                      alt="tolerance function in background eraser tool"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123740/7443" target="_top" id="2123740">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123740" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123740/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="5-Brush-Angle"><a href="#5-Brush-Angle" class="headerlink" title="5.

Protect Foreground Color"></a>6. Protect Foreground Color</h3><p>Sometimes, Photoshop erases parts of your subject while removing the background, no matter what Tolerance value you use. To avoid this, the Protected Foreground Color option in the Options bar can come in handy.</p><p>This option allows you to choose a color from your subject as a foreground color, and Photoshop will stop erasing it while you drag the brush over the image to remove the background.</p><h3 id="7-Pen-Pressure"><a href="#7-Pen-Pressure" class="headerlink" title="7.

Then, select the <strong>Background Eraser Tool</strong> in the Toolbar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/using-the-background-eraser-tool-in-photoshop.png"                      alt="using the background eraser tool in photoshop"                ></p><p>Step2 Now, click and drag over the background area you want to erase. Photoshop will automatically select the area you want to erase as you drag.</p><p>Adjust the size and hardness of the eraser brush by using the <strong>Brush Preset Picker</strong> in the <strong>Options bar.</strong> Alternatively, you can also press the <strong>“Right Bracket (]) “</strong> button to increase the size of the brush and the <strong>“Left Bracket ([)”</strong> key to decrease it.</p><p>Step3 In the next step, set the <strong>“Sampling Options”</strong> to <strong>“Once”</strong> and <strong>“Limits”</strong> to <strong>“Contiguous.”</strong> This will help you avoid erasing the wrong pixel color and remove those positioned closer to each other.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/setting-the-sampling-options-and-limits-in-background-eraser-tool.png"                      alt="setting the sampling options and limits in background eraser tool"                ></p><p>However, if the pixels are positioned far apart from each other, you can set the <strong>“Limit”</strong> option to <strong>“Discontiguous.”</strong> While when erasing the pixels around the subject, set the <strong>“Limits”</strong> settings to <strong>“Find Edges”</strong> to ensure smooth edges.</p><p>Step4 If your image background and subject are of the same color and <strong>Photoshop</strong> it removing parts of your subject during the process, set the <strong>Tolerance</strong> to a <strong>low value</strong> by dragging its slider up or down or typing it in the box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/setting-the-tolerance-value-in-background-eraser-tool.png"                      alt="setting the tolerance value in background eraser tool"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098702/14409" target="_top" id="2098702">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098702" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098702/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step5 When removing pixels from a background, you can preserve specific pixel colors from being removed, which can be helpful if they are close to the area you want to erase.</p><p>For this, place the cursor on the color you want to keep and press &amp; hold the <strong>ALT</strong> (Windows) or the <strong>Option</strong> key (Mac) until the brush changes to the Eyedropper Tool icon. Then, click the area to sample the color in the <strong>Foreground Swatch.</strong></p><p>This will protect the color, and Photoshop will now avoid erasing it while removing the background. You can repeat the process to preserve other pixels while removing the background.</p><p>Step6 Finally, after removing the background, you can place the subject on another image, a solid color, or export it as PNG with transparent BG.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/exporting-the-final-image-after-erasing-background-with-background-eraser.png"                      alt="exporting the final image after erasing background with background eraser"                ></p><h2 id="You-May-Want-to-Know-The-Working-Process-of-Background-Eraser-Tool"><a href="#You-May-Want-to-Know-The-Working-Process-of-Background-Eraser-Tool" class="headerlink" title="You May Want to Know: The Working Process of Background Eraser Tool"></a>You May Want to Know: The Working Process of Background Eraser Tool</h2><p>Now that you’ve learned <strong>how to use the Background Eraser Tool in Photoshop.</strong> During the process of operating, you might wonder how the software works and changes the BG layer.</p><p>To help you understand this process, we’ll create a sample project (image with pink and blue strips) and show you how the tool works:</p><p>After importing the image, when we check the <strong>“Layers”</strong> panel, we can see that the image is labeled as a <strong>“Background”</strong> layer. So now, we want to erase the pink column and keep the blue one to create a pattern.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/checking-the-image-layer-in-the-layers-panel.png"                      alt="checking the image layer in the layers panel"                ></p><p>When we select the Background Erase tool, the cursor changes to a brush that helps Photoshop to sample the colors that come under the <strong>crosshair (Plus)</strong> in the center of the circle. The circle around the crosshair shows the area where the software will erase the pixels (only the pixels with the same color or shades).</p><p>Now, to remove the pink stripes, we’ll move the brush to that part, and when clicked, the area under the circle will be erased. Notice that even if the circle moves to the blue area, it remains untouched because those pixels are not the same shade&#x2F;color.</p><p>Therefore, as long as we keep the crosshair within the pink area, Photoshop will only erase the pink pixels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/checking-the-working-process-of-photo-shop.png"                      alt="checking the working process of photo shop"                ></p><p>However, if we accidentally erase the blue stripes, we can always go back by simply pressing the <strong>“CTRL+Z”</strong> in Windows and <strong>“Command+Z”</strong> in Mac. To undo multiple steps, hit the <strong>“Ctrl+Alt+Z” (Windows)</strong> or <strong>Command+Option+Z” (Mac)</strong> keys repeatedly.</p><h2 id="Common-FAQs-When-Using-Background-Esarser-Tool-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Common-FAQs-When-Using-Background-Esarser-Tool-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Common FAQs When Using Background Esarser Tool in Photoshop"></a>Common FAQs When Using Background Esarser Tool in Photoshop</h2><h3 id="1-Why-Is-Photoshop-Eraser-Tool-Not-Accessible"><a href="#1-Why-Is-Photoshop-Eraser-Tool-Not-Accessible" class="headerlink" title="1.

According to the interval and number of shots, your Canon 80d time-lapse will tell you the number of footage you have to take to end the video. There is a general thumb rule for recording time-lapse videos, and you will need around 24-25 images for each second of your video.</p><p><strong>5:-</strong> Compose the shot and tap on the shutter button. While shooting the time-lapse video, it is recommended that you should place the camera on a tripod to maintain the composition of duration. Also, after you are happy with the composition and settings, you can tap the shutter button and allow your camera to show its magic.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Canon-Time-Lapse-Video-Shooting-Tips"><a href="#Part-3-Canon-Time-Lapse-Video-Shooting-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Canon Time Lapse Video Shooting Tips"></a>Part 3. Canon Time Lapse Video Shooting Tips</h2><p><strong>Never forget to take test shots:-</strong> You must never start shooting straight away. Also, you can take some random test shots. This ensures you get the best composition and angle you are looking for.</p><p><strong>Always take photos in JPG:-</strong> Set the Canon Camera to capture pictures in the best JPG quality, or else you can run out of space quickly.</p><p><strong>Use manual mode:-</strong> It’s recommended to shoot in manual mode, and you must shoot with the manual white balance, exposure, aperture, and shutter speed. Moreover, it will help you to avoid auto-adjusting your camera.</p><p><strong>Carry extra batteries:-</strong> If you want to create a time-lapse video outdoors, you must carry extra batteries. Also, it is good if the camera battery is changed before your camera gets shut down. If you are shooting time-lapse video indoors, it’s better to use the main charger. Also, it will help you avoid excess battery draining.</p><p><strong>Carry Extra Memory cards:-</strong> You will never want to run out of space while making a time-lapse, and you will have to make the calculations according to your time-lapse. Also, make sure you carry the extra memory cards to be prepared.</p><p><strong>Choose the best spot:-</strong> Set your tripod securely and in a place where it cannot be knocked or moved quickly.</p><p><strong>Focus on the camera:-</strong> Always ensure that the equipment and camera are in sight while you are shooting and safe.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982462">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982462.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982462">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982462.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982462%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982462/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Extra-How-to-Edit-Timelapse-Video-on-Computer"><a href="#Part-4-Extra-How-to-Edit-Timelapse-Video-on-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Making your guest answer your questions while drenched in emotions can take your podcast to the next level. Questions like “What were your feelings when this happened?” can take the guest back to the past and make him answer your question with full emotions.</p><h3 id="Mirror-your-guest"><a href="#Mirror-your-guest" class="headerlink" title="Mirror your guest"></a>Mirror your guest</h3><p>Repeat the same few last words that a guest just said when he finishes his thought, and by doing that, you’re creating an intonation that’s sort of like a question. It’s another way to permit the person you’re interviewing to keep going. For example, your question might go like this. Perhaps you’re asking somebody about his favorite software of the year that they’ve used in video editing.</p><p>He might answer like this “one of my favorite software is called <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s a using-friendly video editing software that you can use even to do podcast shows and impressive vlogs. And I love it because I have been editing YouTube videos daily.”</p><ul><li>You: “You’ve been going to edit every day?”</li><li>The Guest: “Yeah, I’ve been editing videos for YouTube for over 200 days. And it’s been really neat to connect with audiences there.”</li><li>You: “Connect with the audience? How?”</li><li>The Guest: “Well, you know it’s posting videos, so there’s intimate interaction with people who seem to be there and watch the videos I post. And I’ve gotten to know many of them by name now.”</li></ul><p>So you see how this can continue to move forward by simply mirroring your guest. Try it in your following conversation, even if it’s not an interview.</p><h4 id="Tell-me-about-a-time-when…"><a href="#Tell-me-about-a-time-when…" class="headerlink" title="Tell me about a time when…"></a>Tell me about a time when…</h4><p>The best thing you can extract from someone in a podcast is their story. If you want to pull out a story from someone, phrase it like this, “Tell me about a time when…” After this question, your job is to sit back, listen, and not interrupt the guest.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Podcast-Questions-to-Avoid-Asking"><a href="#Part-4-Podcast-Questions-to-Avoid-Asking" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Podcast Questions to Avoid Asking"></a>Part 4. Podcast Questions to Avoid Asking</h2><p>Avoiding asking wrong questions is as important as asking good questions. Some questions will negatively impact your podcast’s quality, so avoid asking such questions. Here are some questions that you should not ask.</p><ul><li>Avoid asking questions that your guest is frequently asked. For example, if he appears on numerous interview podcasts and shows, he is likely often asked the same question.</li><li>Avoid asking basic questions like, “What are you best known for?”</li><li>Questions you anticipate will result in a “yes” should be avoided, as a simple “yes” adds little value to the interview for those listening.</li><li>Similarly, avoid asking questions to which you can predict the answer will be a “no.”</li><li>Avoid questions that might offend your guest.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-5-Should-I-Send-an-Advance-Interview-Questions-Podcast"><a href="#Part-5-Should-I-Send-an-Advance-Interview-Questions-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Should I Send an Advance Interview Questions Podcast?"></a>Part 5. Should I Send an Advance Interview Questions Podcast?</h2><p>Yes, you can send interview questions to guests. Therefore, they get time to prepare interesting responses. Also, they may think about their answers or type out lengthy responses. Either way, they’ll feel more comfortable and help you make better content.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134227/18498" target="_top" id="2134227">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134227" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134227/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Take-Your-Content-to-the-Next-Level-and-Gets-Shared"><a href="#Take-Your-Content-to-the-Next-Level-and-Gets-Shared" class="headerlink" title="Take Your Content to the Next Level and Gets Shared"></a>Take Your Content to the Next Level and Gets Shared</h2><p>A podcast is only as good as the questions being asked. By carefully choosing which questions to ask and which to avoid, you can take your content to the next level. It also enhances the interest of listeners.</p><p>Consider the following when picking which of the above questions to use on your show: will it let your guest reveal something about who they are, how they think, or what they know will benefit your audience?

Final Cut Pro is one of the most popular paid video editors that professional video creators recommend. Final Cut Pro is a paid software and you have to pay a hefty one-time fee for lifetime full access. Therefore, it is important that you know everything about Final Cut Pro before purchasing it.</p><p>We have done a complete review of Apple Final Cut Pro. We have stated the key features, pricing details as well as overall performance. Along with these parameters, we have highlighted the pros and cons of Final Cut Pro. Thereafter, you can check out our tutorial on how to edit a video on Final Cut Pro. Finally, we have provided a better alternative to Final Cut Pro if you are not satisfied with FCP.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="1-History-of-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#1-History-of-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1. History of Final Cut Pro"></a>1. History of Final Cut Pro</h2><p>The journey of Final Cut Pro(FCP) began as an alternative to Adobe Premiere Pro. FCP was initially developed by Macromedia. The designer of FCP named Randy Ubillos used to work for Adobe Premiere previously. In 1998, Apple purchased the development team of Final Cut Pro. Hence, Macromedia FCP turned into Apple FCP.</p><p>The popularity of Final Cut Pro started to pick up in the early 2000s. A popular movie producer named Michael Bloom praised FCP to boost its popularity. The software did not crash even once during rendering a movie. Soon, the popular director Roger Avery became the spokesperson for Apple FCP. This encouraged video creators and producers to try out Final Cut Pro as a video editor.</p><p>The breakthrough came in 2002 when Final Cut Pro was awarded a Primetime Emmy Engineering Award. Final Cut Express was launched in 2003 at an affordable rate. But it was discontinued in 2011. This is because Apple launched Final Cut Pro X in April 2011.</p><p>Final Cut Pro X came with a new user interface and workflow. It was packed with loads of new features. Subsequently, new features such as effects, filters, color enhancement, and support for HDR and 360-degree video were introduced. This helped it to become one of the best video editors in the world.</p><h2 id="2-Features-of-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#2-Features-of-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="2. Features of Final Cut Pro"></a>2. Features of Final Cut Pro</h2><p>Final Cut Pro is a feature-rich video editor. Starting from basic features for regular video editing to advanced tools for professional video editing, you get everything in one software. Here are the key features of Final Cut Pro by Apple that you should know.</p><p>Video Cut: You have to deal with multiple video clips for one video project. Naturally, you have to cut and trim video clips and edit them before joining them. Final Cut Pro comes with a state-of-the-art set of trimming tools. Starting from ripple edit and roll edit to slide and slip edit, you can use these techniques comfortably.</p><p><strong>Title and Caption:</strong> Texts are an important part of every video. There is no doubt that a great text effect and a stunning text animation take video to the next level. Final Cut Pro has loads of text effects and presets that you can apply to enhance titles and captions. Starting from opening and ending crediting to lower-thirds and subtitles, there are presets for everything.</p><p><strong>Transitions</strong>: Transitions are an integral part of video editing. Whenever there is a change of scenes, there has to be a transition effect. A transition prevents jump cuts and awkward scene shifting. Final Cut Pro has a wide range of transitions that will enhance your video content.</p><p><strong>Video Effects</strong>: There are over 300 video effects in Final Cut Pro. The more the video effects, the more popular the video editor becomes. But there is no point in having loads of video effects unless they can impactful. Final Cut Pro stands out for its video effects and animations and you can customize them as per your requirements.</p><p><strong>Chroma Key</strong>: You see the use of green screen background in movies and films. Final Cut Pro supports the Chroma key by which you can remove the green screen background. You can replace it with anything starting from static background to dynamic background. Besides, you can add effects and animations to make it dramatic and cinematic.</p><p><strong>Audio Editing</strong>: Last but not least, the audio part of a video is extremely important. Starting from dialogs to background music, everything enhances the video content. Final Cut Pro has a dedicated audio editor where you can edit audio clips as good as video clips. You can also separate sound clips into different audio lanes.</p><h2 id="3-Price-Choices-of-FCP"><a href="#3-Price-Choices-of-FCP" class="headerlink" title="3. Price Choices of FCP"></a>3. Price Choices of FCP</h2><p>Most premium video editors charge monthly, quarterly, or annual subscription fees. But Final Cut Pro does not have any subscription-based pricing model. It charges a one-time fee for lifetime full access. The one-time fee is $299.99 and there are no additional charges for future updates.</p><p>The one-time fee may seem massive but if you use FCP for a few years, it will become rather economical. For a professional video editor who prefers FCP over others, the one-time fee is the most economical price model. You can try out its free trial version for 90 days to understand if FCP is meant for you.</p><h2 id="4-Performance"><a href="#4-Performance" class="headerlink" title="4. Performance"></a>4. Performance</h2><p>FCP is simply a powerful video editor when you compare it with other premium video editors. Every professional video producer rates Final Cut Pro in their top three in terms of performance. The performance happens to be stable and consistent. It takes the least amount of time for rendering among all premium video editors. Thanks to its magnetic timeline and enhanced workflow, video editing has become easy.</p><p>There are loads of features and tools available for advanced video editing. You can edit 4K, 8K 360-videos, HDR, and VR videos without crashing. Object tracking, color grading, and cinematic mode are quite unique and highly useful. Video previewing after applying effects and animations is smooth. The video quality stays consistent and you get what you see after exporting. Overall, the performance of FCP is solid and powerful.</p><h2 id="5-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#5-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="5. Pros and Cons"></a>5.
