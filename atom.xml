The latest edition to the Windows family was rolled out on July 29th, and those who have been able to make the upgrade have had some pretty nice things to say about it. Time will ultimately tell if Windows 10 is really going to be a hit, but early indications point to that being the case.</p><p>If you’re still waiting for the go-ahead from Microsoft to download Windows 10 free, then you at least have some time to look at some of the Windows 10 features.</p><h4 id="1-Top-Windows-10-Features"><a href="#1-Top-Windows-10-Features" class="headerlink" title="1. Top Windows 10 Features"></a>1. Top Windows 10 Features</h4><p>With Windows 10, it would seem as though Microsoft actually listened to people. The improvements to Windows 10 are vast, when you compare them to Windows 8 or Windows 8.1. We all know by now just how unpopular Windows 8 and 8.1 were. Some people even decided to stick with Windows 7 instead.</p><p>Microsoft is clearly looking to bring the world at large on board with Windows 10. To that end, they have brought a number of exciting features to the table:</p><p><strong>Cortana Virtual Assistant</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/update-win10-13.png"                      alt="update win10 13"                ></p><p>Cortana is one of the biggest features Microsoft is rolling out for the Windows 10. If you have been using the Windows Phone, then you already have an idea of what to expect from the tablet&#x2F;PC version. This digital assistant is designed to be vastly superior to Siri or Google Now. You’ll find Cortana next to your desktop’s start button, but you can also say “Hey, Cortana” to bring it to life. You remain in complete control of how much Cortana knows about you, but you’ll definitely love the way Cortana can bring up requested information instantly. Early users have also noted that Cortana is more than capable of maintaining a full, almost-natural conversational flow.</p><p><strong>Edge Web Browser</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edge.jpg"                      alt="edge"                ></p><p>Say goodbye to Internet Explorer. The long-disliked browser is finally being chucked aside, in favor of something that will strive to be decidedly different. Although IE will still support legacy software, Edge is clearly the one taking center stage as the default browser for Windows 10. Features will include a screen grabbing tool that offers touchscreen sketching capabilities, a reading mode, and even a notepad. Search results will be built around your preferences, and you will have the ability as well to get restaurant information or directions shot to you in an instant.</p><p><strong>Windows 10 Start Menu</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/a8.png"                      alt="a8"                ></p><p>No one really liked the start menu layout for Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. Windows 10 offers a fantastic improvement to that end. If the start menu looks quite familiar, that’s because Microsoft has made it a point to bring back the style virtually all of us prefer. Yet Windows 10 will have some decided differences. The start menu will allow you to look over frequently-used apps, use the universal search without swiping, and yes, the tiles will be there, as well. However, you will be able to control how prominent they are.</p><p>These are just three of the new features of Windows 10. Ready to learn about a few more?</p><h4 id="2-More-Windows-10-Features"><a href="#2-More-Windows-10-Features" class="headerlink" title="2. More Windows 10 Features"></a>2.

The Xbox app will give you the ability to control your Xbox One, but you’ll also be able to utilize your DVR capture for your Windows games. Even more exciting is the way you’ll have the ability to play multiplayer titles across between your Xbox One and your PC. With the streaming side of things, Windows 10 will allow you to stream titles from your Xbox Box. There will also be DirectX 12 support.</p><p> <strong>Universal Apps</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/universal_apps.jpg"                      alt="universal_apps"                ></p><p>If you’re going to use Windows 10 across several different devices, you’re going to love this aspect. Photos, Music, Video, Map, People, and other apps will be available across all your devices. Furthermore, Windows 10 will ensure that your apps will look and function the same, regardless of the app you’re using.</p><p> <strong>Design and Interface Improvements</strong></p><p>There is a cohesiveness and consistency to everything that is going to make Windows 10 a highly pleasant experience for most of the people who use it. You’ll find that in terms of design and user interface, Windows 10 is a combination of modern features, the few good things about Windows 8 and Windows 8.1., and elements from past editions that we never wanted to get rid of.</p><h4 id="3-Get-Ready-For-Windows-10"><a href="#3-Get-Ready-For-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="3.Get Ready For Windows 10"></a>3.Get Ready For Windows 10</h4><p>Some people are already enjoying Windows 10.

Irrespectively of its extreme popularity, the platform still lacks certain basic options that are essential for the convenience of the users. For example, you are watching a YouTube video, and you notice something interesting and curious in the background of the subject. You will want to zoom into that portion of the video so that the minute details become visible. However, there is no built-in zoom YouTube video option available.</p><p>The requirement of zooming into YouTube videos is quite basic, and you will definitely need it at some point. You need to zoom videos to magnify and read texts as well as pay attention to details. In spite of YouTube video zoom option not available, there are several ways possible through which you can zoom into any YouTube videos conveniently. We will illustrate all the ways with detailed steps for complete understanding.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0dOfcihxjiw?si=_fkp1S1Uw0N1dp6b" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Way-1-Use-Browser-Zoom-Feature"><a href="#Way-1-Use-Browser-Zoom-Feature" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Use Browser Zoom Feature"></a>Way 1. Use Browser Zoom Feature</h2><p>If you are viewing YouTube videos from your web browser on your computer or smartphone, you can easily zoom into the video. This is because every web browser has the built-in option for zooming the browser window. As the browser window zooms in, the YouTube video playing in the browser will also zoom in. You have to then scroll and place the YouTube video in the center of the browser window for the best result. Here are the steps on how to zoom in YouTube using browser Zoom feature.</p><p>Step1Open your web browser and visit the YouTube website. Play the desired video.</p><p>Step2Click on the three-dot icon at the top-right corner, and you will see a drop-down menu.</p><p>Step3Go to Zoom option and click on “+” to zoom the browser window and thereby, zooming on YouTube video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-in-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="browser zoom youtube video"                ></p><p>Play the video in theatre mode for a better zooming result. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl and “+” keys together to zoom in by percentage.</p><p>When you zoom in on YouTube video using browser zoom feature, the zooming is not very accurate because it does not actually zoom the focused part of the video. The zooming is uniform and you have to place the video on the browser window for the zoom effect to be somewhat effective.</p><h2 id="Way-2-Zoom-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Way-2-Zoom-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Way 2.

The more you know about the type of person who will benefit the most from using your product or service, the better you can tailor your video content to speak directly to them.</p><p>It may seem like a daunting task, but there are several ways you can go about defining who this person is:</p><ul><li>If possible, talk with current customers and ask them what they love about their experience with your business.</li><li>If that’s not an option for some reason (maybe there aren’t any current customers), consider hiring a research firm or marketing agency that specializes in surveying potential customers and asking questions like “What would encourage you to buy from us?” or “How could we improve our service?” With this information in hand, it should be easier than ever before!</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gOyLy8DeizY?si=GkAmK0hChZw6_2tW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Ask-Authentic-Questions"><a href="#Ask-Authentic-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Ask Authentic Questions"></a>Ask Authentic Questions</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ask-authentic-questions.jpg"                      alt="ask authentic questions"                ></p><ul><li>Open-ended questions are the best way to engage customers and get them to speak naturally.</li><li>Make your question relevant to the customer and your product or service.</li><li>The more specific you can be with these questions, the better.

After all, that’s the point of using video testimonials in the first place! Make sure you have a tight script with a few specific questions written down. You should also plan out how you’re going to arrange these questions into a flow.</p><p>When asking someone for their thoughts on a topic or issue, there’s always going to be some variation in how people respond. Some will talk about personal experiences; others will talk about what they’ve learned from others’ experiences; still, others might share some advice for future generations who might encounter similar problems. The key here is that your main objective is not necessarily the information itself (though this can help), but rather the emotion behind it—what effect does this experience have on your audience?</p><p>Asking open-ended questions allows people greater freedom when responding—and while this may sound like an ideal situation when creating content, it often results in less-than-ideal responses when creating content at scale since you won’t always get exactly what you want out of every shot.</p><h2 id="Lighting-Sound-and-Video-Quality-Matter"><a href="#Lighting-Sound-and-Video-Quality-Matter" class="headerlink" title="Lighting, Sound, and Video Quality Matter"></a>Lighting, Sound, and Video Quality Matter</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/lighting-sound-video-quality.jpg"                      alt="lighting sound video quality"                ></p><p>Lighting, sound, and video quality matter.</p><p>This is a given. If you want your testimonial videos to be effective and believable, they need to be properly lit, recorded with good audio quality, and captured in high resolution. While these may seem like obvious must-haves for any video production project—and they are—it’s important to remember that there are many factors at play when it comes to how your audience will perceive the final product.</p><h2 id="Really-Listen-to-Your-Prospects"><a href="#Really-Listen-to-Your-Prospects" class="headerlink" title="Really Listen to Your Prospects"></a>Really Listen to Your Prospects</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/listen-to-your-prospects.jpg"                      alt="listen to your prospects"                ></p><p>When you’re listening to your customers, don’t just take notes on what they say. Also, look at their body language and eye movement. This can tell you a lot about whether they are telling the truth or not, and it will give you an idea of what may be going on in their head.</p><p>If someone says “I love this product,” but then shows their eyes darting around nervously, that could mean that they’re worried about saying something nice about the product because it’s not really meeting their needs. If someone says “It’s okay,” but he or she is nodding along with enthusiasm when talking about it, that probably means he or she really does like it!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1CdWd06fCwc?si=wzg-68q0jAksPRXp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Beware-of-Skeptics-and-Negative-Nellies"><a href="#Beware-of-Skeptics-and-Negative-Nellies" class="headerlink" title="Beware of Skeptics and Negative Nellies"></a>Beware of Skeptics and Negative Nellies</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/beware-skeptics.jpg"                      alt="beware skeptics"                ></p><p>You might have skeptics and negative nellies in your audience.

Live podcasting means recording your episode with a live audience. So, if you are looking for interesting suggestions for a live-stream podcast, luckily, you are at the right place.</p><p>This article explains the power of live-stream podcasts, how to make a live podcast, and the platforms used for it. Talking about its diversity, it can be an interview, monologue, Q&amp;A, customer interview&#x2F;testimonial, educational show, or News. Well, we first have to know the impact podcasts have created worldwide.

Here are some reasons why.</p><h3 id="Get-More-Engagement-With-Audiences"><a href="#Get-More-Engagement-With-Audiences" class="headerlink" title="Get More Engagement With Audiences"></a>Get More Engagement With Audiences</h3><p>Over the years, podcasts have shown constant growth in engaging audiences. Many actors and brands use it as a new way to get more engagement among new audiences keeping the base audience intact. In addition, with the increasing use of smartphones, live-stream video podcast listeners have increased miraculously.</p><p>And that’s amazing as well when you look at the stats worldwide. According to the sources, 57% of whites, 16% of Hispanics, 13% of African Americans, and 4% of Asians currently listen to live podcast streaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-1.jpg"                      alt="greater audience engagement"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fJlICvacgJY?si=jNeijBVj7ia4ammA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0dOfcihxjiw?si=_fkp1S1Uw0N1dp6b" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Express-Thoughts-in-Real-Time"><a href="#Express-Thoughts-in-Real-Time" class="headerlink" title="Express Thoughts in Real-Time"></a>Express Thoughts in Real-Time</h3><p>Another fantastic thing about live-stream video podcasts is the real-time expression of thoughts. You can interact with the virtual live audience and express your feelings, reviews, and ideas on many different topics. So it becomes a two-way conversation. Unlike films, seasons, or dramas, live podcasts show the real side of a person.</p><h3 id="Better-Relationships-With-Audiences"><a href="#Better-Relationships-With-Audiences" class="headerlink" title="Better Relationships With Audiences"></a>Better Relationships With Audiences</h3><p>Podcasts are emerging platforms for creating content. It requires a lot of creative work to get that going. However, most listeners are there to listen to live-stream video podcast content and focus more on it. So it creates a better bond.

We will discuss some key factors to make live podcasting successful here. Let us move step-wise.</p><h3 id="1-Timing-Is-Everything"><a href="#1-Timing-Is-Everything" class="headerlink" title="1. Timing Is Everything"></a>1. Timing Is Everything</h3><p><em>“What is the best time to go live?”</em></p><p>There is no proper answer to this question. Several factors, like your target audience, your niche, and your geographic location, will play a part in the timing of going live. So here, we are going to give you some tips about time management.</p><p>Confirm a schedule with your guest (if you have one), ensuring you’re both on the same page about timing, even if you are not in the same time zone. For example, if you want a maximum live audience in the US, then the best time for you to live stream is when most US live stream viewers are active. You have to make sure your guest should make it to go live as well, irrespective of his time zone.</p><p>Secondly, it is also vital when to hold the live podcasting. It would help if you researched what time you will get the most audience. Consider what type of content you create and what lifestyle your audience leads, and decide accordingly.</p><p>Let’s get into this situation; a Sunday morning might be a good option if your podcast is about meditation and well-being, as it’s a classic time for taking things slow and resetting before the coming week.</p><p>Here is a summary of different social media platforms when you get the maximum audiences.</p><ul><li>YouTube - Weekends 12 PM to 2 PM</li><li>Facebook - Tuesdays and Thursdays 1 PM to 4 PM</li><li>Twitch - All days from 1 AM to 9 AM</li></ul><p>We now move on to take the most fundamental step of our work which is making a checklist of things to do.

The theme, the guests, the intro of the video, and various question and answer sessions need a script to carry things smoothly.</p><p>The writing is fundamental even if you are going to hold a monologue live podcast. So you have to brainstorm your topics and decide on the podcast theme. You have to invite the guests, give your podcast a name, and get the right equipment and setup. Everything needs to be scripted to have a podcast preview.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-5.jpg"                      alt="review your podcast with a checklist"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8dH3yHH9IX8?si=geiW5KbIljSFT9pz" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Set-Up-Your-Podcasting-Gear-Properly"><a href="#3-Set-Up-Your-Podcasting-Gear-Properly" class="headerlink" title="3. Set Up Your Podcasting Gear Properly"></a>3. Set Up Your Podcasting Gear Properly</h3><p>Let’s run through various gadgets used to start live podcast streaming and how to make a live podcast. Let’s dive in!</p><p><strong>Camera</strong></p><p>Good display quality is the most integral part of live podcast streaming. Therefore, a reliable camera is essential for a live podcasting kit. The recommended tool for this purpose is a good-quality webcam. Unfortunately, many people use DSLR and mirrorless cameras, which aren’t suitable for shooting for a long time.</p><p>Here we have some fantastic products for you as an option. When it comes to visual fidelity, 4K resolution isn’t everything. Achieving superb quality is highly dependent on webcam light sensors and pixel size. Here are a few recommendations for you.</p><ol><li>Smartphones</li></ol><p>Everyone has a smartphone, and you don’t need to buy a new gadget, making it a cheaper and easier option. But there are difficulties connecting it to your PC or laptop.</p><ol start="2"><li>Webcams</li></ol><p>Many laptops and PC setups have internal webcams. However, the display gets grainy sometimes. You can also go for external webcams. The external webcams are tiny and portable. Maybe, you can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.razer.com/streaming-cameras/razer-kiyo-pro" >Razor Kiyo Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with more than two micrometers which is superior to other 4K webcams. If you are a beginner with a low budget, you can always go for alternatives.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-6.jpg"                      alt="razor kiyo pro"                ></p><ol start="3"><li>DSLR</li></ol><p>DSLR (digital single-lens reflex camera) is notable for allowing interchangeable lenses on the same camera body. However, it is just one type of digital camera. Investing in DSLR gives options for the future and provides crystal clear images, for example, <a href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/compact-digital-cameras/coolpix-b500.html"><strong>Nikon COOLPIX B500</strong></a>. It captures moments in full HD 1080p quality with stereo sound. It also counteracts shaky hands for tripod-steady videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-7.jpg"                      alt="nikon coolpix b500"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X18Dq7rV-xI?si=twFfXIPD0TFmC5EM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>XLR or USB Microphone</strong></p><p>You might have heard some things about XLR and USB microphones. For example, “XLR microphones sound more professional” or “USB microphones are less of a hassle.” Unfortunately, XLR can’t be connected directly to your computer. Instead, you’ll need an audio interface to enter the digital world and want to make recordings using your computer or smartphone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-8.jpg"                      alt="atr 2100x-usb"                ></p><ol><li>Condenser Podcasting Microphones</li></ol><p>Sensitive to high frequency and environmental noise.

Traditionally used by beginners.</p><ol start="3"><li>XLR Podcasting Microphones</li></ol><p>3-prong connection connected to mixer and computer. Usually used in professional setups.</p><p><strong>Mixers</strong></p><p>The mixer enhances the exemplary audio quality and offers multi-channel recordings. It also provides multiple-channel live recordings as well. Adding this to your live-streaming podcast kit helps to reduce post-production cuts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-9.jpg"                      alt="yamaha mg series"                ></p><p><strong>Lighting</strong></p><p>Lighting is the most intimidating part of the video live-streaming kit. It enables texture and depth to the video. Not only is the lighting essential, but also the positioning of light. It starts to create shadows on a person’s face. Lighting drastically changes how someone looks in live streaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-10.jpg"                      alt="elgato key light mini-portable led panel"                ></p><p><strong>Tripod Stands</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-11.jpg"                      alt="ubeesize 67 phone tripod &amp; selfie stick, and camera tripod stands"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/odDOPrPjRYY?si=7QHzdUkTPNkHJiVj" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>An innovative, sturdy tripod stand can hold your camera and smartphone to capture steady frame shots.

Now you don’t have to get to the offices to earn a decent earning. Instead, you can make your home studios have a live podcasting setup. Let’s have a look at it.</p><p><strong>Home Studio</strong></p><p>You don’t have to be hesitant to make a home studio. It has many pros, as it is easy to design and equip a recording home studio. Also, it is a long-term intelligent investing strategy, especially after the covid pandemic. Moreover, it gives a studio-quality recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-14.jpg"                      alt="a home studio"                ></p><p><strong>Place Establishment</strong></p><p>Establishing a new indoor place is much cheaper and safer.

For example, you must be aware of people passing by while live streaming a podcast in a quiet park corner. It will be difficult for you to focus. Additionally, an indoor venue can better absorb ambient noise.</p><h3 id="5-Carefully-Choosing-a-Live-Stream-Platform"><a href="#5-Carefully-Choosing-a-Live-Stream-Platform" class="headerlink" title="5.

You can change the color, text font, and images or even re-orient the entire template so you end up with a unique meme to suit your needs.</p><h2 id="Kapwing-Meme-Templates"><a href="#Kapwing-Meme-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Kapwing Meme Templates"></a>Kapwing Meme Templates</h2><p>Kapwing is another online photo editing tool that also comes with a built-in meme generator. One of the benefits of choosing Kapwing is the numerous templates that you can use to create a unique meme. Each of the templates that you find on Kapwing is completely customizable.

This is an online photo editing tool from Adobe that can be used to generate memes very easily. While you can use Adobe Express to create a meme from scratch, the easiest way to create a meme is to choose from the numerous templates on the site.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adobe-meme-templates.jpg"                      alt="adobe meme templates"                ></p><p>Once you choose a template, you can use Adobe Express to make changes to the template in various ways. This photo editor has a lot of features to help you make changes to the meme including editing the photos by replacing them with your images, editing the text by changing the font, and even changing the size of the entire meme.</p><p>The only problem with the meme templates that you find on Adobe Express is that they are not very well arranged.

Copyright of Free Meme Templates</strong></p><p>Like every other type of content that you may see online, memes (even free meme templates) are copyrighted. But the reason you don’t hear about this is that meme copyright infringement is rarely enforced. Memes are relatively easy to create and cost next to nothing so pursuing litigation in copyright infringement may not be worth the cost. They are also widely available and it is difficult to figure out where they originated from.</p><p>If you are worried about the legal implications of using a free meme template, you can credit the creator of the meme whenever you use it. But because it can often be difficult to find out who created the meme, this may be very difficult. The only way to overcome these legal challenges may be to use some of the meme templates on this page to create your own meme that will be unique to you.</p><p><strong>2.

Use the following tips to learn the best tactic:</p><h3 id="Memejacking"><a href="#Memejacking" class="headerlink" title="Memejacking"></a>Memejacking</h3><p>Memejacking is using these famous memes as a mode of transportation. Many memes last for weeks, months, or even years, but a brand-new meme is always spreading. Jumping on current trends while they’re new and, most crucially, relevant is the key to meme success. Memes that are the result of singular incidents are ideal for this. Everyone shares as many of them as they can when they first appear, but once the meme is finished, it is over.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/meme-jacking.jpg"                      alt="meme jacking"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wVVp-GggK3U?si=RJb1ClNQV7GjTu_3" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="“No-One”-Meme"><a href="#“No-One”-Meme" class="headerlink" title="“No One” Meme"></a>“No One” Meme</h3><p>The “no one” meme is certainly one you’ve seen flying around the internet. Its purpose is to suggest an unusual or bizarre notion that no one requested in the first place or to draw attention to an oddity that everyone shares but that goes unmentioned, such as turning down the radio in the vehicle while checking up directions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/no-one-meme.jpg"                      alt="no one meme"                ></p><h3 id="Contrasting-Memes"><a href="#Contrasting-Memes" class="headerlink" title="Contrasting Memes"></a>Contrasting Memes</h3><p>When we use our talents of observation and identify a connection between two things, humor sometimes results. Then we create a side-by-side comparison meme to communicate that realization to the rest of the globe. The audience also values well-written, concise conversation. Be inventive, but stick to the proven strategies you are familiar with.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/contrasting-memes.jpg"                      alt="contrasting memes"                ></p><h3 id="Relatable-Memes"><a href="#Relatable-Memes" class="headerlink" title="Relatable Memes"></a>Relatable Memes</h3><p>For a meme to gain significant popularity, it doesn’t always have to be utterly humorous. The finest memes sometimes do a fantastic job of encapsulating a certain mood that we can all relate to. By connecting this kind of meme to the issues that their goods address, brands may evoke a deep emotional reaction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/relatable-meme.jpg"                      alt="relatable memes"                ></p><h3 id="Text-In-Outline-Meme"><a href="#Text-In-Outline-Meme" class="headerlink" title="Text In Outline Meme"></a>Text In Outline Meme</h3><p>There aren’t any absolute laws in the domain of memes. Maybe all you want to do with a wonderful photograph is add some text, particularly if it’s the traditional white font with a black outline. Additionally, a silly animal picture is always a good choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/text-in-outline-meme.jpg"                      alt="text in outline meme"                ></p><h3 id="Evolving-Memes"><a href="#Evolving-Memes" class="headerlink" title="Evolving Memes"></a>Evolving Memes</h3><p>Memes cover a wide range of subjects, from commonplace issues to significant national and international events. Every day, more are produced and shared, and fresh content is always accessible. Some memes come from contentious forums, while others could use unpleasant stereotypes. A good rule of thumb is to conduct some study before employing a meme if you’re unsure of what it refers to or why it’s meant to be humorous.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/evolving-memes.jpg"                      alt="evolving memes"                ></p><h3 id="Solitary-Words"><a href="#Solitary-Words" class="headerlink" title="Solitary Words"></a>Solitary Words</h3><p>One picture and one phrase form the basis of this meme. Make them interact. Emphasize the meme in it. Memes have a huge following that is inclined to like and spread the material. One worder memes may be effective icebreakers, even in the somewhat stuffy world of B2B marketing.

Many memes last for weeks, months, or even years, but a brand-new meme is always spreading. Jumping on current trends while they’re new and, most crucially, relevant is the key to meme success. Memes that are the result of singular incidents are ideal for this. Everyone shares as many of them as they can when they first appear, but once the meme is finished, it is over.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/meme-jacking.jpg"                      alt="meme jacking"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gOyLy8DeizY?si=GkAmK0hChZw6_2tW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="“No-One”-Meme-1"><a href="#“No-One”-Meme-1" class="headerlink" title="“No One” Meme"></a>“No One” Meme</h3><p>The “no one” meme is certainly one you’ve seen flying around the internet. Its purpose is to suggest an unusual or bizarre notion that no one requested in the first place or to draw attention to an oddity that everyone shares but that goes unmentioned, such as turning down the radio in the vehicle while checking up directions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/no-one-meme.jpg"                      alt="no one meme"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LT4sdZgUvRQ?si=SvQD5FouEzu4UHpJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Contrasting-Memes-1"><a href="#Contrasting-Memes-1" class="headerlink" title="Contrasting Memes"></a>Contrasting Memes</h3><p>When we use our talents of observation and identify a connection between two things, humor sometimes results.

One of the benefits of memes is that they can be swiftly updated.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-complete-critique-gopro-hero4-silver-sensor-for-2024/"><u>[New] Complete Critique GoPro HERO4 Silver Sensor for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-analyzing-hero5-black-and-yi-4k-cameras-for-modern-adventurers/"><u>[New] In 2024, Analyzing Hero5 Black & Yi 4K Cameras for Modern Adventurers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-photo-sharpening-mastery-with-1-10-online-editors/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Photo Sharpening Mastery with #1-10 Online Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-revealing-veiled-youtube-reviewers-opinions/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Revealing Veiled YouTube Reviewers' Opinions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-assessing-visual-clarity-entering-aurora-hdr-territory/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Assessing Visual Clarity Entering Aurora HDR Territory</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-chucklecanvas-draw-hilarious-social-media-art/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, ChuckleCanvas Draw Hilarious Social Media Art</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-low-budget-camera-buys-roundup-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Low-Budget Camera Buys Roundup for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/engage-in-confidential-chats-using-duckduckgos-innovative-ai-platform-alongside-chatgpt/"><u>Engage in Confidential Chats Using DuckDuckGo's Innovative AI Platform Alongside ChatGPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/in-2024-elevate-your-visual-storytelling-mastering-pixizs-video-capabilities/"><u>In 2024, Elevate Your Visual Storytelling Mastering Pixiz's Video Capabilities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-music-from-samsung-galaxy-m14-5g-to-ipod-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer Music from Samsung Galaxy M14 5G to iPod | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-immerse-in-ideas-multitasking-activities-for-podcast-fans/"><u>In 2024, Immerse in Ideas Multitasking Activities for Podcast Fans</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-ispoofer-is-not-working-on-vivo-x90s-fixed-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, iSpoofer is not working On Vivo X90S?

One thing is important to note that although anyone can send or buy super hearts, you must be approved as a super broadcaster prior to cashing in real money.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-money-on-periscope.JPG"                      alt="make money on periscope"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4q6gyaEojM?si=ImdFm6Zsr0azykqV" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Prepare-Live-Streaming-With-Right-Plan"><a href="#Part-2-Prepare-Live-Streaming-With-Right-Plan" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Prepare Live Streaming With Right Plan"></a>Part 2: Prepare Live Streaming With Right Plan</h2><h4 id="1-Find-Out-What-You-Really-Want-To-Live-Stream"><a href="#1-Find-Out-What-You-Really-Want-To-Live-Stream" class="headerlink" title="1. Find Out What You Really Want To Live Stream"></a>1. Find Out What You Really Want To Live Stream</h4><p>When you start out with live streaming of videos, it becomes essential to pick the right topic that can attract viewers. You must be able to understand and choose one particular thing you like to be known about.</p><p>Is it the trending games or anything else that people are concentrating more on? You need to find the right subject for your video live streaming in order to make money on Periscope. Once a particular topic is selected, suppose you wish to live stream games, try to analyze which game is the most trending one.</p><p>Try to check out the search engines and other gaming sites to find out the games that are the most in news but not yet, saturated. If you are not sure which topic to choose, you may look into gaming communities and forums to see which game is the most focused one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-to-stream-periscope.JPG"                      alt="stream on periscope"                ></p><h4 id="2-Consistent-Streaming"><a href="#2-Consistent-Streaming" class="headerlink" title="2. Consistent Streaming"></a>2. Consistent Streaming</h4><p>It is essential to maintain a consistent schedule while publishing content. What does that mean? It means that the time span of the live streaming must be consistent in order to keep your audiences informed. If your audiences have to keep waiting and they are not aware of your posting schedule, they might lose interest and focus.</p><p>Suppose you have 3 videos ready and you stream for 3 consecutive days and then disappear for 3 weeks. It gives the wrong message to your audiences. So, it is better to live stream consistently on a weekly basis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Consistent-Streaming.JPG"                      alt="Consistent Streaming."                ></p><h4 id="3-Talk-to-Yourself-if-You-Are-Shy"><a href="#3-Talk-to-Yourself-if-You-Are-Shy" class="headerlink" title="3. Talk to Yourself if You Are Shy"></a>3. Talk to Yourself if You Are Shy</h4><p>Are you a camera-friendly person? If not, then live streaming can be a quite intimidating task for you, especially if you are shy. Facing the camera and seeing and hearing yourself can be awkward if you are not used to it.</p><p>So, try and make it a habit to face the mirror, overlook any flaws that you might be observing, and talk to yourself continuously as much as you can. Increase at least 10-15 seconds with each session of chatting with yourself in the mirror. This will increase your confidence and help you in making yourself comfortable and at ease while you talk.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/talk-periscope.JPG"                      alt="talk periscope."                ></p><h4 id="4-Make-a-Script"><a href="#4-Make-a-Script" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a Script"></a>4. Make a Script</h4><p>Having a hard and fast script and narrating or speaking mugged up lines like a school kid can completely ruin your video. So, try to be spontaneous. Keep the points you wish to include in your video handy and refer to it every now and then to have a clear picture of what you would like to say. But, do not make a video as if someone forced you to speak. Be natural and sporty.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/writer-script-periscope.JPG"                      alt="writer script periscope."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Kr7Dpw0HuM?si=05wWDXdPgmC-oBBE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Make-Money-On-Periscope-With-Tactics"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Make-Money-On-Periscope-With-Tactics" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Make Money On Periscope With Tactics"></a>Part 3: How To Make Money On Periscope With Tactics</h2><h4 id="1-Doing-Active-Interaction"><a href="#1-Doing-Active-Interaction" class="headerlink" title="1. Doing Active Interaction"></a>1. Doing Active Interaction</h4><p>If you want to make money on Periscope, it is essential to reach out to your audiences. Apart from the stream chats, you must share all your social handles like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. with all your subscribers.</p><p>Sharing your social media handles does not mean that you have to befriend all your subscribers, but you may share the social page which you want your subscribers to follow, where they may post any query or know more about your live streaming videos. Such active interaction is essential in order to make money from live streaming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/periscope-interactive.JPG"                      alt="interaction periscope."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e4Nt2xXXtmE?si=CtKwFry4b0AJXnaN" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="2-Find-A-Company-To-Let-Them-Sponsor-You"><a href="#2-Find-A-Company-To-Let-Them-Sponsor-You" class="headerlink" title="2. Find A Company To Let Them Sponsor You"></a>2. Find A Company To Let Them Sponsor You</h4><p>When a company agrees to sponsor your live streaming video, you get paid to live stream. Do you know how? Your followers may not be aware that they are seeing a coffee mug with a company logo, or a service pitch in the background while you are explaining something or talking to your audiences.</p><p>But, you make money on Periscope on a regular basis for just sharing the services or products while streaming live. Getting hooked on the big and right brands and companies can earn you handsomely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sponsor-periscope.JPG"                      alt="sponsor periscope."                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AcAYRX0cwwA?si=DxqWU39vqksZbe1s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="3-Create-Value-for-Your-Audience"><a href="#3-Create-Value-for-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="3. Create Value for Your Audience"></a>3. Create Value for Your Audience</h4><p>Never share any below grade and useless videos with your audience. In order to make money from live streaming, ensure valued information and an interesting watch for your viewers. Worthy content and a great presentation can rope in more subscribers and retain the existing ones, in addition to getting paid to live stream.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>With the live video content setting the trends, always ensure if you are making one, you must get paid to live stream. Twitter, supporting the Periscope app is a great way to make money from live streaming. Follow the above points and make money on Periscope by sharing great live content which the viewers would love to gain knowledge from and watch glued to it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZeYbTVeaXg0?si=rwLL1DbBoX26BGjm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-an-in-depth-review-of-dji-drone-model-3s-performance/"><u>[New] An In-Depth Review of DJI Drone Model 3'S Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-zoom-video-enhancement-from-blur-to-clarity/"><u>[New] In 2024, Zoom Video Enhancement From Blur to Clarity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-elevate-your-mobile-film-experience-with-optimal-accessories/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Elevate Your Mobile Film Experience with Optimal Accessories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-hidden-insights-for-importer-mastery-on-windows-10/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Hidden Insights for Importer Mastery on Windows 10</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/approved-innovator-of-cinematic-soundscapes-and-imagery/"><u>2024 Approved Innovator of Cinematic Soundscapes & Imagery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/2024-approved-seamless-youtube-experience-on-apple-gear-downloading-made-easy/"><u>2024 Approved Seamless Youtube Experience on Apple Gear Downloading Made Easy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/cambiar-de-codificacion-de-video-h265-a-h264-sin-costo-o-perdida-en-calidad/"><u>Cambiar De Codificación De Video H.265 A H.264 Sin Costo O Pérdida en Calidad</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/eliminate-youtube-previews-a-comprehensive-instructional-guide/"><u>Eliminate YouTube Previews A Comprehensive Instructional Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/in-2024-1-general-trivia-challenge-web-series/"><u>In 2024, 1 General Trivia Challenge Web Series</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-2-ways-to-monitor-infinix-smart-8-plus-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 2 Ways to Monitor Infinix Smart 8 Plus Activity | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/in-2024-kinemaster-app-for-android-complete-review/"><u>In 2024, KineMaster App for Android - Complete Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/quick-resolution-of-elgato-hd60-driver-glitches-with-our-expert-tips/"><u>Quick Resolution of Elgato HD60 Driver Glitches with Our Expert Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-error.techidaily.com/reattach-regaining-lost-bluetooth-connection-in-manager/"><u>Reattach: Regaining Lost Bluetooth Connection in Manager</u></a></li><li><a href="https://program-issues.techidaily.com/top-strategies-for-getting-your-division-2-game-running-again/"><u>Top Strategies for Getting Your Division 2 Game Running Again</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

If you find yourself in low-light conditions or you’d like to raise the quality of the sound of your video recording you might need the aid of the camera accessories. Even though the iPhones have made the image making process almost effortless they too have their limits and in some situations, it is impossible to capture a video or a photo without using some of the equipment that is considered standard in most professional camera setups.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >iPhone X Camera Features for Better Photography <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>On the other hand, having all the gadgets for iPhone photography doesn’t guarantee that you’ll immediately become a great photographer. Photography and videography require creativity, exploration, and experience thus relying too much on the equipment can be counterproductive. The accessories we are going to cover simply widen a number of things that you’ll be able to do with your iPhone, but they are in no way a prerequisite for a great shot. Let’s take a look at some of the accessories that will make your life as an iPhone photographer or videographer much easier.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FLO5dwmJAVs?si=1OYH8rv8aPaMsCiU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tripod-with-Phone-Mount"><a href="#Tripod-with-Phone-Mount" class="headerlink" title="Tripod with Phone Mount"></a>Tripod with Phone Mount</h2><p>Being perfectly still while taking the picture or while you are recording something can be extremely difficult. To make things even worse iPhones are very light for a camera and even breathing can cause the unwanted movement. The tripod’s main purpose is to ensure that the camera is perfectly still while you are using it. <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018UP7Z5O/ref=as%5Fli%5Fss%5Ftl?keywords=gorilla%20pod%20magnetic&qid=1458755433&ref_=sr_1_2&sr=8-2&linkCode=sl1&tag=thapfa-20&linkId=88fc16ee78056eedb4fed585d9f4d73c" >GorilaPod Magnetic <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>is a tripod that is intended for ultra light cameras, which makes it an excellent choice as a tripod for your iPhone. It sticks to any magnetic surface and it can be wrapped around anything else. GorilaPod Magnetic is tiny and it can be easily carried around, but the tripod’s mount can have problems holding the iPhone for a long period of time in an unnatural position.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-tripod.jpg"                      alt="iphone-tripod "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MTb4xHzeQEk?si=9Sqq-gFWnHc8x3_P" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Remote-Shutter-Release"><a href="#Remote-Shutter-Release" class="headerlink" title="Remote Shutter Release"></a>Remote Shutter Release</h2><p>How to press the record button without ever touching your phone? The answer is simple. Use Remote Shutter Release and make sure that your iPhone is perfectly still while you are taking photos or recording videos. Even though most iPhone cameras are equipped with a self-timer that allows you to move away from a camera using them means that you have a limited amount of time to take a shot. Remote Sutter Release devices like <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HHZY2ZM/A/hisy-selfie-camera-remote" >HISY Bluetooth Camera Remote <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> enable you to take your time and carefully plan your pictures.

A lens is probably the most important part of any camera and since most built-in lenses on iPhones have limitations an external lens is a perfect solution to those limitations. Using external lenses such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.shopmoment.com/" >Moment Lenses <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will ensure that the images you create with your iPhone live up to the standards of professional photographers. You can choose between Fisheye, Wide-angle, or Telelenses since each of them provides you with a new set of possibilities. Moment lenses are light and easy to mount on your iPhone, which is why carrying them on your road trips and adventures requires minimum effort. Using an external lens is a great way to improve the quality of images you take with your iPhone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-lense.jpg"                      alt=" iphone-lense"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PNw3Lb26wFA?si=5NR1XRVSp41EQYMy" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="External-Light-Source"><a href="#External-Light-Source" class="headerlink" title="External Light Source"></a>External Light Source</h2><p>To photograph or to film something simply means to capture the light at the certain place in a certain moment. Due to the lack of light that is not always possible and an additional source of light is often necessary to ensure that camera receives enough light. Using a camera flash can be a quick solution for this problem, but the light the flash produces can be too hard and it always comes from the same direction. <a class="link"   href="https://photojojo.com/awesomeness/pocket-spotlight" >Photojojo’s pocket spotlight <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an external light source that allows you to get creative with light in your videos or photos.

A few years have passed since Guardians of Galaxy Vol. 2, the first full-feature movie shot in 8K was released, but in the meantime, only a few 8K cameras have emerged.</p><p>The industry-leading camera manufacturers like RED, Sharp or Ikegami have already released 8K cameras, but their prices are still too high for most cinematographers. So in this article, we are going to take a look closer look at some of the best 8k cameras you can find on the market in 2024 and see what they have to offer.</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >11 Best Bridge Cameras [Ultimate Review] <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-an-8K-Camera"><a href="#What-is-an-8K-Camera" class="headerlink" title="What is an 8K Camera?"></a>What is an 8K Camera?</h2><p>The <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >resolution <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>determines the maximum quality of pictures a video camera can capture. Each frame an 8K camera records can either have 7680 or 8192 pixels on the longer side of the frame and between 2160 and 8192 pixels on the shorter side of the frame depending on the video’s <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >aspect ratio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Commonly an 8K video with the standard 16:9 aspect ratio has 33.9 million pixels or a resolution of 7680x4320 pixels.</p><p>It is worth noting that the resolution of still images is different than the video resolution, as it is measured in megapixels. Technically, any camera that has more than 25 MP can capture photos that have 7680x3200 pixels, which means that models like <a class="link"   href="https://www.hasselblad.com/x1d/" >Hasselblad X1D II 50C <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/eos-dslr-and-mirrorless-cameras/dslr/eos-5ds-r" >Canon EOS 5DS R <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can already take photos that have the same number of pixels like 8K videos. However, these medium format cameras cannot record videos in 8K resolution.</p><p>8K video cameras function on the same principle as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K or Full HD cameras <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>as they utilize a lens and a sensor to record images on the camera’s memory card. Currently, the size of the files 8K cameras produce is one of the major reasons why cinematographers are still reluctant to embrace them since 40 minutes of footage can take up to 2 terabytes of storage space.</p><p>The images recorded with 8K cameras can be used for live broadcasts, in cinemas or they can be displayed on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >8K television sets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Even so, 4K and Full HD videos are still the industry standard and it remains to be seen if 8K technology is going to change that.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hZsnjxeSh1U?si=hZIfzQPDNX5KtOCg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Which-Aspects-Should-You-Consider-When-Choosing-an-8K-Camera"><a href="#Which-Aspects-Should-You-Consider-When-Choosing-an-8K-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Which Aspects Should You Consider When Choosing an 8K Camera?"></a>Which Aspects Should You Consider When Choosing an 8K Camera?</h2><p><strong>How Much Is An 8K Camera?</strong></p><p>At the moment only professional cinematographers have any reason to purchase an 8K camera, as the price of the least expensive models varies between $24,000 and $50,000.

Most of the 8K camera models can capture footage at 60fps, although their <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >bit rates <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can vary, which impacts the speed at which data is transferred.

However, a number of Canon’s models are already equipped with <strong>50MP</strong> sensors that can capture still images in resolutions that go as high as <strong>8712 x 5813</strong> or record videos in 4K resolution at 60fps.</p><p>Models like <a class="link"   href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/products/details/cameras/eos-dslr-and-mirrorless-cameras/dslr/eos-5ds" >EOS 5DS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Mirrorless-Digital-Camera-Body/dp/B07H484HLT" >EOS R <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, are powerful enough to enable you to take still images at resolutions that resemble those provided by 8K cameras. However, the exact date when Canon is going to unveil their first 8K camera is still not known, but if any of the rumors are true it could easily happen that we are going to see the Canon’s first 8K camera in 2020.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vQbNyknjJJ8?si=RGVIEWLdPbvRC_r6" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Nikon"><a href="#2-Nikon" class="headerlink" title="2. Nikon"></a>2. Nikon</h3><p>Even though Nikon is one of the leading camera manufacturers in the world, there are still no 8K Nikon cameras. After Apple’s WWDC event information surfaced that Nikon is developing a new 8K model, but this information has been dismissed as false soon after the event.</p><p>At the moment the <a class="link"   href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/dslr-cameras/d850.html" >Nikon D850 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the closest to an 8K camera this manufacturer has to offer since this 47.5 MP camera can record time-lapses in 8K resolution, although only by combining the footage captured with two D850 models.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/nikon-d850-8k-time-lapse-camera.jpg"                      alt="Nikon D850 8K Timelapse Camera "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3C51hzX46eY?si=o5qiDSkT7mXUGm3F" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Image resource: Nikon</p><p>This Nikon’s camera has also 7fps continuous shooting mode as well as the capability to record 4K UHD videos at 30, 25 and 24 fps. Nikon D850 has an FX CMOS sensor that can capture images that have 8256 x 5504 pixels and the ISO sensitivity that ranges from ISO 64 to ISO 25,600.</p><p>The camera is compatible with G, E, and D AF Nikkor lenses as well as DX and AI-P lenses, which provides you with enough versatility to shoot virtually any scene you want. Whether or not Nikon is going to add 8K cameras to their assortment of products is not yet clear, and it may be a while until one of the largest camera manufacturers in the industry releases its first 8K camera.</p><h3 id="3-Sharp"><a href="#3-Sharp" class="headerlink" title="3. Sharp"></a>3. Sharp</h3><p>A few years ago, Sharp introduced 8C-B60A, the world’s first 8K camcorder and a few years later there are only a few cameras that have the features that can be compared to those you can find on the 8C-B60A camcorder.</p><p><strong>The Super 35mm equivalent single-plate CMOS sensor</strong> has approximately <strong>33 million pixels</strong>, while the <strong>quad-link 12G-SDI output terminal</strong> enables capturing and broadcasting footage live while the recording session is still in progress.</p><p>8C-B60A can record <strong>8K 10-bit videos at 60fps</strong>, although you can set the frame rate to 50, 30 or 24fps. The camcorder is also equipped with a <strong>2TB SSD pack</strong> that can store up to <strong>40 minutes of 8K footage</strong> and it offers the possibility to use the SDHC card for proxy recording. 8C-B60A utilizes the <strong>Grass Valley HQX Codec</strong> to compress the raw video files at a <strong>6 Gbps compression rate</strong>.</p><p>It features two <strong>AUDIO IN XLR type 3 pins</strong> and one <strong>MIC IN XLR type 5 pin</strong>. The camcorder doesn’t have batteries and it is powered through a <strong>130W 13V DC output AC&#x2F;DC adapter XLR 4-pin</strong>. The Sharp’s 8C-B60A 8K camcorder is undoubtedly one of the best 8K cameras you can buy in 2024, despite the hefty price tag.</p><h3 id="4-Sony"><a href="#4-Sony" class="headerlink" title="4. Sony"></a>4. Sony</h3><p>Professional cinematographers don’t need an introduction to Sony’s cameras, as the Japanese camera manufacturer has been at the forefront of the digital camera market for decades. Their <a class="link"   href="https://pro.sony/ue%5FUS/products/digital-cinema-cameras/f65#SATD501220TheF65Cinealta-f65" >F65 CineAlta <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> was released in 2016, but it is still one of the best 8K cameras you can buy in 2024. This speaks volumes about the F65’s capabilities, much like the fact that professional cinematographers have nothing but praise for this Sony’s camera model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sony-f65-cineAlta-8k-camera.jpg"                      alt="Sony F65 CineAlta 8K Camera "                ></p><p>Image resource: Sony</p><p>The <strong>1-chip 20MP Super 35mm type</strong> <strong>24.7mm X 13.1mm</strong> <strong>CMOS sensor</strong> enables you to capture videos in 8K, 4K or 2K resolutions. The camera’s <strong>PL lens mount</strong> is standard for all film cameras, which means that you won’t have too much trouble finding the lens you can use with F65 CineAlta.</p><p>The camera has <strong>14 stops of exposure latitude</strong>, so if you are shooting RAW video files F65 will utilize the <strong>S-Log3&#x2F;S-Gamut3 gamma curve</strong> to ensure accurate color depiction. In addition, this 8K camera can capture <strong>275,000,000,000,000 color variations</strong> even while you are shooting in full resolution at 60fps. Unsurprisingly, F65 CineAlta costs more than $60.000, but it is still a great investment for all professional filmmakers in need of a camera that can deliver great performances regardless of the available light.</p><h3 id="5-Ikegami"><a href="#5-Ikegami" class="headerlink" title="5. Ikegami"></a>5. Ikegami</h3><p>Ikegami is a well-known manufacturer of professional broadcast cameras, so it comes as no surprise that the first handheld 8K UHD Television Camera System was produced by this Japanese television equipment manufacturer. Their <a class="link"   href="https://www.ikegami.com/archives/menu1/shk-810" >SHK-810 8K Super Hi-Vision Camera System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> features a <strong>Super 35mm 33 million-pixel CMOS Sensor</strong> as well as <strong>4,000 TV lines</strong> which enables the camera to capture highly-detailed images.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ikegami-8k-super-hi-vision-camera-system.jpg"                      alt="ikegami 8K Super Hi-Vision Camera System "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/it8VkxDUdAc?si=ef6VZWR7kW4P9ikh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Image resource: ikegami</p><p>This broadcast camera has <strong>a PL lens mount with a back-focus adjusting mechanism</strong> that helps the camera operator to keep the image sharp even while recording rapidly moving figures and objects. The SHK-810’s output signal features are equally impressive since you can choose between <strong>SHV Dual Green SDI Interface, 4K SMPTE 424M (3G-SDI) Level B and HD SMPTE 292M</strong> options.</p><p>In addition, you can choose between <strong>2-channel x 4K and 4-channel HD</strong> return signals or opt for <strong>Tri-Level Sync</strong> or <strong>VBS</strong> external sync signals. However, SHK-810 is bulky and heavy, as it weighs 9kg or 19.6 lbs without a viewfinder which makes it difficult to use without a tripod during events that last for several hours. Moreover, the camera is aimed at large television networks rather than filmmakers and cinematographers, and at the moment Ikegami doesn’t offer any 8K camera models that are designed for filmmaking purposes.</p><h3 id="6-Red"><a href="#6-Red" class="headerlink" title="6. Red"></a>6. Red</h3><p>The list of TV shows and movies shot on RED cameras is seemingly endless and it includes some of the best movies made over the last ten years. Models like <a class="link"   href="https://www.red.com/DSMC2-BRAIN?quantity=1?sensor=1" >Monstro 8K VV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, <a class="link"   href="https://www.red.com/DSMC2-BRAIN?quantity=1&sensor=2" >Helium 8K S35 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.red.com/DSMC2-MONOCHROME-BRAIN?quantity=1&sensor=2" >Helium 8K S35 Monochrome <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> are all <strong>modular DSMC2 cameras</strong> that can be used with different types of lenses. Each of these 8K cameras has a <strong>35.4 MP CMOS sensor</strong>, however, the size of the sensor depends on the model. All RED’s 8K DSMC2 cameras can write data at <strong>300 MB&#x2F;s</strong> and they have an incredibly high dynamic range that varies from <strong>16.5+ to 17+ stops</strong>, which enables them to capture a broad spectrum of colors.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/red-dsmc2-brain-monstro-8k-w.jpg"                      alt="Red DSMC2 BRAIN"                ></p><p>Image resource: red</p><p>Furthermore, each of the Red’s 8K cameras can record 8K videos at <strong>60fps</strong> while they also offer the possibility to capture <strong>7K, 6K, 5K or 4K</strong> videos at different frame rates. In addition, these modular cameras are equipped with the <strong>Apple ProRes codecs</strong> that ensure high image quality throughout the video recording and editing processes.</p><p>The body of an 8K Red camera can cost between <strong>$24,000 and $50,000</strong> which makes these cameras available only to professional film and TV productions. It is also worth noting that the footage captured with any of the 8K RED camera models can be edited in only a handful of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >professional video editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> products.</p><p>Still don’t know to choose which?

Red, Sharp or Sony are going to continue to be the best option for cinematographers who want to shoot their footage in 8K resolution, even though it is highly unlikely that the prices of 8K cameras are going to go down in the foreseeable future.</p><p>In addition, Canon and Nikon only offer 50 MP cameras that can capture still images that have the same amount of pixels as 8K videos, but there are no indications that these manufacturers are going to release new models that can record 8K videos.
