## Part 4\. Advantages and Disadvantages of Vita Video Editor App

Let's look into the advantages and disadvantages of Vita Video Editor more deeply:

### Advantages

#### **1\. Easy to Use**

Hence, Vita indeed has a user-friendly interface. All the features are easy to use with a little bit of understanding. No Ads make it a more effective and clean app. The built-in libraries also provide a great range of things you need for editing. Instead of finding these resources like filters, videos, and music online and downloading them, you can easily add them using this built-in free store.

#### **2\. Premium Features**

You're getting premium tools at no cost when using Vita App. The free features in Vita Video Editor are similar to the premium apps.

#### **3\. Full HD**

Only a few video editing apps offer more detailed Exporting, especially on mobile phones. Thankfully, Vita is one of them.

### Disadvantages

#### **1\. Stuck and Heating Problem**

Some users have faced hanging issues in Vita App while exporting, adding media, or opening a project. This is a big drawback because some users even stated that after completing their whole work, they aren't able to export it. On the other hand, in some older devices, the app has complained about heating problems.

#### **2\. Music Copyright Issue**

There are also some complaints regarding the music available on Vita. People think it is royalty-free, but one YouTuber complained that he used the music from Vita in his video but got a copyright claim. This issue tends that the music is not royalty free.
