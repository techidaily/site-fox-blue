No. YouTube offers you cross-platform functionality, meaning the changes apply to all devices you use to access your account. So, for example, YouTube thumbnail previews will be disabled across your desktop, smartphone, and tablet, regardless of where you made the change.

#### 2\. Can you disable YouTube video ads?

However, you can customize them to suit your tastes by customizing your [**Google Ad Settings**](https://adssettings.google.com/).
