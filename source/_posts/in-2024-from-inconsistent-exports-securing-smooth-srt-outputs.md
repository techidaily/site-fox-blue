## Part 1: Why Does Premiere Pro Export SRT Subtitles Fail

There are several reasons why Premiere pro export SRT subtitles might fail. The common ones include;

**Wrong Element Selection in The Project Panel**

Yes, when you’re exporting SRT, if you fail to select the caption file before you use the relevant buttons for exportation, the “Export” option will be grayed out. Hence, preventing you from being able to export the SRT file.

**Improper settings selection**

If, unfortunately, you select the wrong settings for your file during the exportation of SRT, there's a high chance that you'll not be able to complete the export action successfully.

## Part 2: How to Fix Premiere Pro Export SRT Subtitles Fail

Fixing the Premiere pro export subtitles fail error is not a daunting task if you know the right tricks to execute the operation. Here, we’ve explained three methods that are not just reliable but also work for fixing export SRT from Premiere pro not working issue. Keep reading to find out more about these fixes.

### Method 1: Use Export Media Option

The “Export Media” option in Adobe Premiere Pro is effective for exporting SRT without problems. However, using this method means you’re exploring the .srt file with a video file. The process to use this method is outlined below;

Step1 Firstly, right-click on the SRT file from the Premiere pro software project panel. Then select 'Export Media.'

![select export media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/fix-for-exporting-srt-file-from-premiere-1.jpg)

Step2 Once you click on “Export Media” you’ll notice different options. Ignore the video export options (or tick off 'video' if you like), then navigate down to the “Captions tab”.

Step3 Click on “Create Sidecar File” under 'Export Options.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Step4 Finally, navigate to 'File Format' and select SubRip Subtitle Format (.srt). Then hit the “Export” button to complete the operation.

### Method 2: Export SRT as Sidecar File

Another way to export SRT files from Adobe Premiere Pro is by exporting the file as a sidecar file. You might ask “What is a sidecar file?” A sidecar file refers to a computer file that stores data that is not supported by the format of its source file. The sidecar file from the source could be more than one, and it could contain meta databases.

Now let’s take a look at the step-by-step process to export SRT as a sidecar file.

Step1 Click on the “SRT File” from the Premiere Pro interface.

Step2 Navigate to “File” and select Exports, then choose “Captions”. By doing so, you'll be able to export the SRT file.

### Method 3: Export SRT File with Timestamps

The previously mentioned methods will allow you to export SRT either with video or as a sidecar file. But if you’re looking to export SRT file with timestamps, this method will work for you. The process is straightforward as the prior discussed methods.

Here is how the process works;

Step1 Firstly, select SEQUENCE in the project panel.

Step2 Up next, click File -> Export -> Captions. Once you complete that, you’ll export the SRT file as a sidecar file with timestamps.
