## Express Creativity for Free – Your Meme Toolbox Awaits

When creating a meme, you will find that it is much easier to start with a pre-designed template. The creators of these temples take into account what is needed to create the perfect meme and even the dimensions needed to upload the meme to various social media sites. This eliminates a lot of work for you, allowing you to create a meme in a few minutes; after all, you can just select a pre-made template and change the images and text to suit your project’s needs.

In this article, we will be looking at some of the best places to find free meme templates that you can then use to create your memes. All the memes that you can find on all these sites are available to download and edit. If you want to create a meme from scratch, you can download the meme template and use a photo editor to change all aspects of the template.

## Canva Meme Theme

Canva is one of the most popular photo editing tools in the market and one of the things that Canva users love about this platform is the availability of templates. There is a meme template on Canva for any type of meme that you would like to create and once you have settled on the meme that you would like to use, you can then use the Canva editor to customize it as desired.

![canva meme theme](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/canva-meme-theme.jpg)

Canva makes it very easy to find the template you need as the templates are arranged under various categories. You can also use various filters including filters, style, theme, price, and color to find the perfect template. Most of the themes on Canva are free but there are some advanced templates that you can access on a paid subscription or for a one-time fee.

The Canva editor has a lot of different features to allow you to edit your selected template in various ways. You can change the color, text font, and images or even re-orient the entire template so you end up with a unique meme to suit your needs.

## Kapwing Meme Templates

Kapwing is another online photo editing tool that also comes with a built-in meme generator. One of the benefits of choosing Kapwing is the numerous templates that you can use to create a unique meme. Each of the templates that you find on Kapwing is completely customizable. You can change the color of the existing images, add your images, change the text font and color and even remove or replace the meme’s background.

Kapwing also makes it easy for you to find the templates that you need. All available templates on Kapwing are neatly arranged in various categories. The “Trending Now” category allows you to find memes that are relevant to the current market and may get you the best engagement.

## Adobe Meme Templates

If you are looking to create unique and high-quality memes, Adobe Express is one of the best tools to use. This is an online photo editing tool from Adobe that can be used to generate memes very easily. While you can use Adobe Express to create a meme from scratch, the easiest way to create a meme is to choose from the numerous templates on the site.

![adobe meme templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adobe-meme-templates.jpg)

Once you choose a template, you can use Adobe Express to make changes to the template in various ways. This photo editor has a lot of features to help you make changes to the meme including editing the photos by replacing them with your images, editing the text by changing the font, and even changing the size of the entire meme.

The only problem with the meme templates that you find on Adobe Express is that they are not very well arranged. The home page is a list of templates of various genres and themes and you may find that it is quite a chore to find the unique template that you would like to use.

If you are not looking to create highly sophisticated memes, ImgFlip is a great simple solution that you can use.

![imgflip meme template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/imgflip-meme-template.jpg)

But ImgFlip is not a complete photos editor, meaning that you may not able to change the template too much.

## Knowledge of Meme Templates

**1\. Copyright of Free Meme Templates**

Like every other type of content that you may see online, memes (even free meme templates) are copyrighted. But the reason you don’t hear about this is that meme copyright infringement is rarely enforced. Memes are relatively easy to create and cost next to nothing so pursuing litigation in copyright infringement may not be worth the cost. They are also widely available and it is difficult to figure out where they originated from.

If you are worried about the legal implications of using a free meme template, you can credit the creator of the meme whenever you use it. But because it can often be difficult to find out who created the meme, this may be very difficult. The only way to overcome these legal challenges may be to use some of the meme templates on this page to create your own meme that will be unique to you.

**2\. Trending Meme Topics**

You may notice that memes constantly change and a meme that was popular yesterday, may not be very popular today. The following are some of the top trending meme topics recently;

* Prince Louis at the Queen’s Birthday in June
