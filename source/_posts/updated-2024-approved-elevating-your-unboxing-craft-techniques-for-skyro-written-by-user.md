### Tip 1: Keep Your Videos Short

Primarily, look at the basic factor of TikTok that actually attract a viewer. The first thing you should keep in mind while creating an unboxing video is to make it short. People who want to watch long videos can do that on YouTube, but the TikTok audience loves short videos. As you already know, TikTok allows you to create videos of 15 seconds, 60 seconds, 3 minutes, and 10 minutes.

However, the optimal recommended length for good and engaging TikTok's 21 to 34 seconds. TikTok comprises hyper-specific algorithms which could detect if the viewer watched your video to the end or just passed it up. Thus, ensure you don't make long **unboxing TikTok** videos, which will bore the viewers.

### Tip 2: Use the Right Hashtag to Reach Your Audience

One of the most common and effective ways to increase followers on any platform is to use the hashtag. No matter if you are working on **kawaii unboxing TikTok** or a technical one, always use the right hashtag. It is like you are taking part in the conversation on social media.

Furthermore, hashtags lead to high user engagement and promote your brand. Therefore, if you have no idea about picking hashtags related to your product, the table mentioned below will help you:

| **Hashtag**        | **Total Views** |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| **#Unboxing**      | 2.9B            |
| **#unboxingasmr**  | 585.8M          |
| **#unboxingtoys**  | 427.6M          |
| **#unboxingvideo** | 362.8M          |
