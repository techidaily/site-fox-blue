## Things to Know When Editing GoPro 4K Videos

**Editing Format**

You might be aware of the fact that GoPro records videos in MPEG-4 whereas the output files contain .MP4 extension. These files are mostly compressed with the help of  codec. As the final output file is with MP4 codec format so the editing software ahead must be capable enough to process this particular file format. So before you decide your editing software, ensure that it is able to handle GoPro output file format.

**Output Format**

The free editing software program must produce files with acceptable extension. In case if you wish to share your videos on internet using social media applications then the editing software must be also capable enough to assist users in easy uploading. One more option is to burn files directly to DVD; in that case your editing program must be capable enough to write into disc directly.
