This is a big drawback because some users even stated that after completing their whole work, they aren't able to export it. On the other hand, in some older devices, the app has complained about heating problems.

#### **2\. Music Copyright Issue**

There are also some complaints regarding the music available on Vita. People think it is royalty-free, but one YouTuber complained that he used the music from Vita in his video but got a copyright claim. This issue tends that the music is not royalty free.
