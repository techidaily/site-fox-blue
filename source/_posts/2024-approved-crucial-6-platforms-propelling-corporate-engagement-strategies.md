## Crucial 6 Platforms Propelling Corporate Engagement Strategies

Social media is a great way of promoting your business. With so many platforms, it can be hard to know which ones to use, so here's a guide to some of the best social media platforms for business.

![business social media platforms](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/business-social-media-platforms.jpg)

## TikTok

TikTok is a video-sharing platform. It's the most popular video-sharing platform in the world and has 30.8 Million daily active users. TikTok was founded by Zhang Yiming, who also founded Byte Dance, which owns TikTok. TikTok is based in Beijing, China, and was launched in September 2016.

![tiktok app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/tiktok-app.jpg)

It's great for promoting your business with short, engaging videos. You can use TikTok to show off your products, give behind-the-scenes looks at your business, or even just tell your brand story. You can also use TikTok to run ads.

## Facebook

Facebook currently has 1.908 billion daily active users, giving it a huge audience to reach customers. Facebook also has a lot of information about its users, which means they can target their ads more effectively than other platforms.

![facebook app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/facebook-app.jpg)

Facebook's advertising options are extensive and include Pros and Cons:

Advantages include being able to show your product at different stages in its lifecycle (e.g., pre-order vs. purchase); being able to target what kind of consumer you want; and having access to analytics that allow you to see how well your ads are performing (i.e., number of clicks/impression).

Disadvantages include not knowing if people are going directly from clicking on an ad and buying something else online instead; not being able to tell if someone who saw an ad might have come back later to buy something from you instead, or spending too much money on ads without seeing results immediately (the latter is one reason why some businesses don't like using Facebook as much).

## Twitter

Twitter, the platform that started off as a way for people to share their thoughts up to 280 characters or less, has become much more than that. It is a great way to communicate with your customers and it can also help make your brand stand out. Twitter allows you to engage with potential customers and get feedback from them about what they think of your product or service.

![twitter app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/twitter-app.jpg)

If you want customer service feedback in real-time then Twitter is probably one of the best ways to do it because users are always on their phones looking at social media throughout the day. Also, Twitter is one of the easiest platforms to use so if someone needs help they can easily get it by tweeting someone who works there directly.

## YouTube

There are plenty of reasons why YouTube is a great platform for business. Here are some of them:

You can create and share content. If you want to start sharing your knowledge with the world, then this is a good place to start. The only thing you need is a camera and an internet connection!

![youtube app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/youtube-app.jpg)

It's a great place to connect with people who have similar interests as you do, or even just connect with people in general (if what they're interested in has something to do with your field).

You can learn things too! There are tons of tutorials available on YouTube that will teach any skill imaginable - everything from learning how to play guitar or speak Spanish, all the way up through creating entire websites from scratch (which may be more than some people want). If there's something specific that interests me personally then I know I'll probably find it there somewhere because there are millions upon millions of videos uploaded every day by millions upon millions of different people worldwide."

## Instagram

Instagram is a visual platform, so it’s no surprise that it’s one of the best social media platforms for business. Not only can you use Instagram to promote your brand and products, but it also allows you to build customer engagement and build a community around your brand.

![instagram app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/instagram-app.jpg)

Instagram also has the advantage of being owned by Facebook, which means that you can easily transfer followers from Instagram onto Facebook.

## LinkedIn

LinkedIn is a social media platform that is designed for business networking. It can be used to find customers, connect with industry thought leaders, and build relationships with other businesses.

![linkedin app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/linkedin-app.jpg)

LinkedIn is also a great place to post content, whether it’s articles, videos, or infographics. This is because LinkedIn users are generally more engaged than users of other social media platforms, and they’re more likely to read and share content that is interesting and relevant to their industry.

One disadvantage of LinkedIn is that it can be difficult to stand out from the crowd if you’re not a large or well-known company. This is because there are already so many businesses on LinkedIn, and many of them are already well-established.

## Conclusion

So, what’s the best social media platform for your business? I think the answer is different for everyone. The important thing is that you find out where your customers are and how they use social media. Then, you can join them on their favorite platforms and connect with them there.
