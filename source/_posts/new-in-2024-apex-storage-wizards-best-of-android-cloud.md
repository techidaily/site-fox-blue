**Q1: Which cloud has the most storage space available?**

Google Drive. Google Drive is the most popular **app for cloud storage** platform, and it has more than a billion users all over the world. It's the most well-known cloud storage option and among the best regarding huge files.

**Q2: How can I receive a free cloud space of 2 terabytes?**

pCloud is one of the most excellent free cloud storage alternatives available, with a storage capacity of 2 terabytes (TB). It stands out due to its unlimited remote upload traffic function. It gives its basic accounts a free storage capacity of 10 GB worth of space to use.
