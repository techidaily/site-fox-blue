## How to use GoPro Hero5 Black

### Explore the Appearance

#### 1.Replace lens Protector

The best thing to know about Hero5 black is that this device is developed with waterproof body so you need not to use any additional waterproof housing with it. But the drawback is that it makes your lens susceptible to damage and scratches. It is better to buy a replacement GoPro protective lens cover to replace your lens cap. While fixing it, never forget to apply little pressure and then simple rotate cap in clockwise direction for 1/8th turn.

#### 2.Lock the Touch Screen

It is essential to lock the screen while capturing your videos otherwise you may face crash of videos due to accidental swipe on screen. To activate this screen lock function, you simply need to swipe down on your screen and on settings bar press the padlock shaped icon. In order to unlock the screen again you have to swipe down again on screen and then again press the padlock to unlock your screen.

#### 3.Side Charging Door

A portable power bank can be directly connected to your GoPro device while keeping your side charging door open. It can easily extend your video shooting hours from one hour to 8 hours. You simple need to open the side charging door and next pull as well as bend at the same time. It will easily come right off; you need not to apply extra force to do this task. While attaching your side charging door ensure that the mechanism is completely extended.

### Have Fun with the New Features

#### 1.Voice Command

In order to turn this feature on, you simply need to swipe down on main screen of your Hero5 Black device and then go to voice command icon. Whenever your camera is powered On then you can control various functions by just speaking few dedicated commands to your camera. These commands start with GoPro as like:

* GoPro, Start recording
* GoPro, Shoot Burst
* GoPro, Start time lapse
* GoPro, HiLight
* GoPro, Photo mode
* GoPro, Turn Off
* GoPro. Video mode
* GoPro, take a photo
* GoPro, stop recording
* GoPro, Time lapse mode
* GoPro, turn Off

The HiLight voice command in this series will simply mark your video right at that moment and then Quick editing app will use the portion exactly before your command to create final video. In case if you forget any of these commands then they can be easily found under preferences list of your GoPro device. It is also possible to use any preferred language setting for voice commands out of 10 suported languages.

#### 2.Timelapse Mode

Your GoPro device can assist you with Time Lapse mode to create special slow motion footage. This mode is specially utilized to shoot city streets as well as for sports activities.

In order to make settings for this mode:

* When you want to hide the settings then just tap on screen.

You can easily record Full HD, 2.7K and 4K resolutions but audio cannot be recorded. The frame rate can be varied from 60 fps to 0.5 fps with simple settings. Here the shorter intervals are preferred for shooting action or sports but longer intervals can be used to record lengthy duration activities. For capturing beautiful scenes of sun rise or sun set it is good to switch to mid range fps values.
