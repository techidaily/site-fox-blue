## Thriving in the Streaming Scene: Overcoming Subscriber Limitations

Thanks to the booming Internet technology and the huge Internet user base, live streaming has been rapidly emerging around the world in the past two to three years. And live streaming from mobile is more convenient for anyone than any other device.

But as we all know, YouTube only allows accounts with **1000 subscribers to live stream** using mobile. So, only for those who do not have 1000 subscribers yet on their YouTube account. And want to live stream from their mobile. We are going to discuss these methods here today in this article.

## Method 1\. ManyCam

ManyCam is a live streaming software. It allows you to use your webcam to live stream on multiple platforms. It has excellent features like various video resources, fantastic filters, etc., and is available for desktops and mobile users. So using its application on your mobile, you can stream live on YouTube without having 1000 subscribers on your channel.

### Download

The download links to the app are here: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/manycam/id1112694921?ls=1) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.visicommedia.manycam).
