## Enhance Imagery in Canva - The Ultimate 10 Guide

Everyone likes to do photography either for commercial purposes or for personal use. Moreover, you can opt for photography as a profession and earn unlimited monetary benefits. However, photography is not limited to capturing pictures as it only includes the editing phase. There are numerous photo editors in the market to conduct photo editing, but non-professionals are not aware enough to use such tools.

This article will include some valuable tips that you can apply through a professional editor: [Canvaphotoeditor online](https://www.canva.com/). Let’s dig into details to know more about photo editing.

## Part 1: 10 Helpful Tips for Using Canva Photo Editor

If you have clicked a photo that does not look artistic, creative, or flawless, you can still improve the quality of your photo through exceptional photo editing. Through the peculiar features and tools of the Canva image editor, implement the following tips to enhance your images effortlessly. You should look into these!

### 1\. Remove Background

The background of your image is an integral part of the portrait as it facilitates grabbing the viewer’s attention. While capturing a picture, it is possible that there are some unnecessary objects or people in the frame. Or, in some cases, the background looks dull and ruins the whole image. Canva has introduced its background remover, through which you can quickly erase the background of your picture.

Moreover, you can design or choose pre-made background templates on this tool to add a vibrant and creative background. Thus, an eye-catchy background on your pictures can make a good impression of yours. Isn’t it great?

Just like other photo editors, Canva photo editor also has its exclusive filters that range in various options such as summer glow, natural tint, and many more. You can adjust the intensity of filters with your fingers and can manage their brightness, saturation, contrast, and tint effects.

Other interesting effects include BadTV, through which you can add cinematic and vintage effects to your photos by exploring different options. Thus, enhance and beautify your photos with a few swipes, and you can confidently post them across social media platforms. You should try it!
