## Part 3: PewDiePie’s success story: Why he is trending on YouTube?

The popularity of PewDiePie on YouTube can be well accessed by the number of subscribers that the channel has- over 111 Million till date with over 16 billion views on content from people across the globe.

PewDiePie is one of the oldest existing channels that is still uploading videos regularly, and this is one of the major factors along with others that makes the channel so popular and known among its followers.

We have studied the channel and its content and found many other factors that attribute to the channel’s popularity. Check them out below.

**3\. Perfect Niche and interesting topics**

For any channel to be a hit, the content plays a major role and PewDiePie clearly knows what the audience wants. The channel from his early days picks up the relevant topics that have also seen growth over the years. Having a niche in gaming content, there is no competition yet for PewDiePie.

**4\. Regular uploading of video**

Another important factor that makes PewDiePie popular is its regular video upload that keeps the subscribers interested and looking forward to the next one.

In addition to the above, entrepreneurial mind-set, eye-catchy content and visuals, and appreciation towards the fan are some of the many other reasons accounting for the success and popularity of PewDiePie.

**Most Famous videos of PewDiePie on YouTube**

PewDiePie has uploaded multiple gaming and other comic content videos that are popular among viewers. Still, if we look at all of them, there are a few which are all-time-hit and most popular ones. Below is the list that we have made for the same.
