## Tip 2\. DIY Light Focus and Control

Shaping light is a crucial component of filmmaking, requiring command over creating and guiding shadows. You need to focus the light on the subjects rather than the background. Use the following methods to focus light on the point of interest.

### DIY LED Panel

You can create LED Panel at home to add light to a subject. Unfortunately, LED strips do not produce bright light when spread as a straight line. However, we can use cardboard and LED light strips to build a broader, more brilliant light. Follow the steps below to make DIY LED Panel.

**Steps**

Step 1 Take a cardboard and an LED strip.

Step 2 Using glue or tape, stick the LED light strip on the cardboard in a spiral shape.

Step 3 Make sure the gap between each spiral is uniform.

Step 4 Plug in the LED strip and use this LED Panel for a broader light source.

Alright! Let's check out how it looks in the video below.
