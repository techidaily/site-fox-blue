Step2 Move the Speed slider to the right or left to increase or decrease the playback speed.

### Method 2: Speed Customization

Using [Speed Ramping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58kkvq8V40M), where the playback rate of a clip varies interactively, you may produce adjustable speed effects in addition to continuous speed variations in Uniform Speed. Multiple playback velocities can be adjusted for each segment of the video.

**Note:** Speed Ramping is our new & advanced feature, you can learn more about speed ramping at this page: <https://filmora.wondershare.com/speed-ramping.html>.

Step1 You will see a few options after selecting the movie in the timeline, clicking the Speed symbol, and choosing the Speed Ramping option. The options are as follows:

![few options after selecting the movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/best-video-speed-controller-extensions-14.jpg)

* **Customize**: Five-speed points, by default, let you set the speed precisely how you like.
* **Hero Moment**: There are eight-speed intervals in the video's playback rate, representing a regular, fast, slow, fast, and standard rhythm: 1.0x, 1.0x, 5.4x, 0.5x, 0.5x, 5.4x, 1.0x, and 1.0x.
* **Montage**: The various (six) speed levels in the video's playback speed—0.9x, 0.9x, 6.9x, 0.3x, and 1.0x—present a slow, slow, fast, slow, and regular pace.
* **Bullet Time**: There are six different speed levels in the video's playback speed, representing a fast, fast, slow, fast, fast rhythm: 5.2x, 5.2x, 0.5x, 5.2x, and 5.2x.
* **Flash in:** The chosen video has four-speed points: 5.2x, 5.2x, 1x, and 1x, which display a fast, fast, normal, normal rhythm.

There are other options like a flash out and jumper, too, later on.

Step2 To use variable video speed, just choose one of the presets and alter it as necessary. Speed changes will continue to work until the Play head reaches the next speed point. The Play head will progressively shift between the speed points with the video's speed.

![use variable video speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/best-video-speed-controller-extensions-15.jpg)

* **Change the section's coverage area**: To alter the area implementing the speed, drag your speed point to the left or right.
* **Removing the speed point**: Choose it and press the Plus - button to delete a speed point.
* **Add speed point**: To add a speed point, move the play head to the location where you wish to adjust the speed, and then click the Plus + symbol on the left.

There are other options available too.

Step3 To view a preview of the video's alterations, use the Spacebar or hit the Play option in the Preview screen. To save your changes, press OK. By selecting Save as a custom option, you could also save the speed ramping configuration.

Apart from slowing down and speeding up the video, the speed control extensions also become beneficial with exceptional features like rewinding, etc., so you never miss out on something important.

For professional video editing, it's best to leverage the Filmora tool, as it comes with one of the best built-in video speed controllers. If not, you can try and use any of the extensions mentioned above as per your browser. However, these extensions will serve best for generic and day-to-day usage purposes.
