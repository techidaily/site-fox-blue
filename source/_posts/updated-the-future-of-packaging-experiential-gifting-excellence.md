Colors play an important role in showing the creativity and standards of a brand. For example, you may notice that almost every box in McDonald’s is in red and yellow color. It creates a rhythm of customization and captivates buyers' attention. You can select a brand's tone by considering various aspects. It includes products, voice charts, targeted audience, and core values.

If you are going to start a decor business, you should use royal colors for unboxing, like pitch black and chocolate brown. Other than this, never produce stuff that cannot follow your brand's theme; for example, a pinkish makeup box shouldn’t have Nike sneakers in it.
