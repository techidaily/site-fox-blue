## Editing Enhanced: Mastering Movies in Windows 11 Environment

However, the demise of the 19-year-old program opened the door for alternative **movie maker windows 11**, which is included with Windows 11.

It will therefore be pre-installed alongside other applications like Microsoft Family. In Windows 11, Clipchamp is intended to take the place of Windows Movie Maker as a video editing program.
