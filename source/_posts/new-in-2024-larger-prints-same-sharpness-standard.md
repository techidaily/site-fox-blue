# Best Image Enlargers: Making Photographs Larger Without Losing Quality

Resizing images is a routine step during the photo editing process. The size of all photos is often reduced in order to make a picture better suited for use on social media. On the other hand, enlarging a photo can be more complicated than it sounds. Increasing the overall number of pixels in a photo can easily cause pixelization, especially if the original photo was in low resolution. Blurriness, JPEG compression artifacts or image noise are also among frequent unwanted side effects of blowing up digital images.

Choosing the right software can help you avoid the potential dangers of enlarging images, which is the reason why we are going to take you through some of the best online as well as Mac and PC-based image enlargers.

## Enlarging Photos Online Without Compromising Quality

The resolution of an image determines how much that image can be enlarged without losing any quality. For instance, if the photo’s resolution is 600x400 pixels, trying to increase it up to 4000x3000 pixels can cause **blurriness or pixelization**. Let’s have a look at some of the best online tools for enlarging low-resolution photos, without compromising their quality.

#### 1. [PhotoEnlarger](https://www.photoenlarger.com/)

**Price:** Free

The largest resolution of a photo you can upload to PhotoEnlarger is limited to 1920X1080 pixels, which makes this tool perfectly suited for blowing up images that are relatively small in size. In order to import a photo, you can click on the Browse icon and navigate to the folder on your computer where the picture is stored or you can simply drag and drop the file to the **Select Image to Enlarge** area of the tool’s page. **The Scale** value is going to be set to **200%** by default, which means that your image is going to be **doubled in size**, and the PhotoEnlarger platform lets make your photo up to **four times larger than the original**. After selecting the Scale value or inserting new values into the **Width and Height boxes** you just have to click on the **Enlarge button** and wait for the picture to be enlarged. The four versions of the picture in different sizes are going to be generated you can crop each of them and download them.

#### 2. [ImageEnlarger](https://www.imageenlarger.com/)

**Price:** Free

The **Zoom Factor** option lets you choose how enlarged the photo is going to be and **Target Width and Target Height values** enable you to change the resolution of the image you’re enlarging.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Besides offering the basic tools like rotate and crop images, the ResizeImage platform enables you to increase or decrease the size of your pictures. The crop option can be useful if you want to enlarge only a small portion of a photo. In the **Resize Your Image section** of the webpage you’ll be able to spot a **Scale slider**, but **its value can’t exceed 100%,** which means that you can’t use it to enlarge images.

![ best image enlarger ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resizeimage-online-image-enlarger-2.jpg)

Make sure that the **Keep Aspect Ratio** checkbox is selected to avoid distorting the picture, and then proceed to increase the values in the **Width and Height boxes**. If the original file had a width value of 1200 pixels you can double it to 2400 pixels without any risk of quality loss. The **height value** will be **adjusted automatically** if the Keep Aspect Ratio option is enabled. The new size of the photo will be displayed at the bottom of the screen. Directly above it is the **Resize button**, click on it and then click on the **Download Image button** to save a photo to a hard drive.
