## Decoding the Vertical Video Enigma on Insta

Are you worried that your video on Instagram is sideways?

There are a few possible reasons why your Instagram video is sideways. One option is that you uploaded the video with the wrong rotation. Another possibility is that you took the video with your phone's camera in the wrong orientation. Finally, Instagram may not have been able to detect the proper orientation of the video, causing it to be shown sideways.

## Why does Instagram keep flipping my video?

Because Instagram is built to display videos in landscape mode, it may be flipping your videos sideways. This indicates the video will be rotated to be wider than it is tall, which is the standard video orientation.

So, when you post a vertical video to Instagram Stories from your camera roll, it is automatically cropped to a 9:16 aspect ratio. Because your phone camera didn't automatically alter the orientation before you started filming, films filmed horizontally can sometimes be posted sideways.

## How to rotate videos for Instagram?

Individuals currently choose to capture films utilizing high-resolution cameras rather than large video cameras on mobile devices. However, you may overlook the video's orientation, resulting in a completely reversed recording.

Don't be alarmed! You can easily restore the video to its original state using various free programs (instead of turning your neck to watch the video). Here are a few basic tools for rotating, flipping, and turning your videos (both software and web-based options).

Many applications and softwares can be used to rotate videoes, but among all of them, Filmora is one of the highly recommended software.

### 1\. Filmora

In Filmora, you can rotate your movie to whatever angle you choose. You may also quickly zoom in or crop out the video parts that you don't want to watch. Predefined aspect ratios such as 16:9, 9:16, 4:5, 1:1, and others are also included to assist you in easily finding the best aspect ratio for YouTube, Instagram, and other sites. But, first, let's look at how to change a video's orientation in Filmora.

**Step 1: Import the video**

Launch Filmora and drag the video onto the timeline.

**Step 2: Rotate the video**

Double-click the video clip on the timeline to open the video editing window. Under the "Transform" menu, look for the "Rotate" option. You can change the rotation value by sliding the slider or entering a certain value. It is possible to rotate up to 360o. For example, if you want to rotate this clip 90 degrees, write "90" in the box, and the video clip will be rotated.
