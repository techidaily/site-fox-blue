The stout white attractive plastic body; fixed landing legs, four rotors and the decent size- it all represents Phantom 3 professional from DJI. You will find this device light enough to carry in your purse but note that you need to unscrew those blades to pack it perfectly.

Manufacturers say that this drone can spend at least 23 minutes in air with single charge but it also depends upon your speed controls.
