You can use Adobe Photoshop CC to apply LUTs to your creation with ease. Additionally, it comes with preset LUTs to help you achieve a variety of color outcomes. For example, there are plenty of LUTs to give your image an artistic look, as if it was a painting. Additionally, you can use the program on both Windows and Mac devices, including handheld macOS devices.

With the basics out of the way, here is how to use LUTs in Photoshop:

## Looking for LUTs for Video? Try Filmora

Filmora is an easy-to-use video editing program available for both macOS and Windows. It offers you an interactive interface with preset LUTs you can apply to achieve exceptional finishes for each project. Some of the adjustments you can perform with the program include color grading, monitor calibration, and color transfer across different software.

Here is how to use LUTs in Filmora.

#### 1\. Download Filmora

Check the Filmora website to download your compatible version. Then, proceed with the installation to start using the video editing program.

#### 2\. Upload your video

Select the video you want to edit and drop it on the FIlmora timeline. Ensure you click the video so that it is active for editing.

#### 3\. Apply your LUT

Select Tools from the top menu in your workspace. Then, click on Color Correction from the dropdown menu. This opens the LUT importer, where you will click on Load new LUT to choose from a variety of presets and custom LUTs from your device. Once you find the LUT you need, press OK to apply the LUT.

Here are a few things to consider before using LUTs on Filmora.

* You may need to color correct your video before applying any LUTs. For example, your white balance needs to be on point to achieve the best results.
* Videos vary in quality depending on the equipment you use. Therefore, you may not receive the same results from applying the same LUT.
* You will need a subscription to access all of Filmora’s editing tools.
