## Part 5: How To Add Motion To Your Video With Alight Motion Alternative

Some video editors prefer using desktop video editors because they can use multiple hard drives on it. High-definition footage requires a large amount of space that a smartphone can't offer. If a hard drive gets filled, you can change it with little or no interruption to your work.

If you don't want alight motion and you want to add motion to your videos, you can try its alternative [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
