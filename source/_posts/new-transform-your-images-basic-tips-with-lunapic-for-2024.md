 In photography, the subject in your image should be aligned perfectly so that it can attach the attention of the audience quickly. That's why cropping the image is required and necessary to make perfect alignments. Every photo editor has a tool to crop the image, but Lunapic photo editor stands out as it offers an exclusive auto-crop feature. This Lunapic crop option can automatically adjust the ratios by making the picture's subject align in the center.

If you are not satisfied with the auto-crop feature, you can manually crop the picture according to your preferences. Thus, auto-crop helps in situations where you don't have extra time to manage the ratios and borders of the frame manually. This is great!
