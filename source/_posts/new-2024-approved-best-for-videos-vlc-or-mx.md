### The User Interface

 Users reviews say that the first appearance of MX player is not so impressive and do not even contain a well designed menu area that is popular in case of VLC. But one must say that MX is perfect choice if you want to stay focused with video content delivery. Other than annoying ads, you will not find any other distraction on its interface.

 In case of VLC, you can definitely enjoy finest screen controls with well managed search menu and it also offers refresh options to stay tuned with updated library. Users can easily switch between audio and video files over VLC.

### Viewing Media

 It is really difficult to prove that any one of these players perform better in terms of viewing media category. Both of these offer great content delivery but you can put VLC on higher side just because of its ability to play videos without cluttering screen with ads. MX keeps on distracting users with so many ads that can even cover your desired video content on screen. You need to make payment to get pro version of MX that is free from ads but VLC is always free with loads of quality features.

### Extra Features

 Developers often keep on improving their media player software with advanced features so that viewers can enjoy incredible experience. But in case of VLC you will find least modifications and it appears same from so many years. This tool is just fine for basic users if you don’t expect additional stuff.

 On the other side, MX player can serve your video watching needs in better manner with added features. Its lock screen feature can keep kids out of control and gesture control feature enables users to enjoy easy controls over brightness and volume.

 One more interesting thing to note about MX player is its advanced hardware integration. However, both these systems offers satisfactory services but still the constant updates on platform features make things more useful.
