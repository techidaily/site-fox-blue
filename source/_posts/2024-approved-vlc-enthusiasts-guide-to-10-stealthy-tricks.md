### 1\. Creating Audio and Video Effects

Many times we feel like audio and video on a media file are not well synchronised and it appears very annoying. Most of you might be curious to get an idea about how to fix trouble and further you may also want to add few new effects to develop customized videos. To do this, simply open VLC media player on your system and then navigate to Tools option. Now hit the Effects and Filters option from dropdown menu. Further, select video effect or audio effect (whichever you want to adjust). It will allow users to apply wide range of effects and one can also view the changes side by side. It is much easier to adjust parameters like hue and brightness etc on VLC media player. Move to Synchronization tab to get your audio and video files perfectly synchronised, the action will be accomplished within few seconds.

Hit the Disc tab and under disc selection option, choose radio button of your inserted disc now select your preferable codec type and save your file with desired extension.
