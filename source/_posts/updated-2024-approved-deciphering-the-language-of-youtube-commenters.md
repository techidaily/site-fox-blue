## Deciphering the Language of YouTube Commenters

All social media has a comment section where in those who watch or follow you are free to comment on your videos or posts. They can share what they want to say or suggestions about your posts.

If you are a content creator who makes product reviews, the comment section is also one that will help the brand. Most brands want to have a voice on matters that affect them. The most powerful way to do that on YouTube is to make amazing videos on topics dear to your heart. But you don't want people to think of you as merely a broadcaster. Social media requires that you be social and make intelligent comments on your videos and those of others, showing that you are trying, and engaging with your audience.

## Advantage of YouTube comments

If you're wondering whether you really need to monitor your YouTube comments, here are three compelling reasons why you should:

* YouTube comments can help you gauge customer sentiment: How do your viewers respond to your content? Positively? Negatively? Not at all? Monitoring your comments can help you understand how viewers feel about your brand.
* YouTube comments present an opportunity for engagement: Responding quickly to negative comments could help you improve your image-not just with an unhappy viewers, but also with other YouTube viewers who see how you respond to conflict.
* YouTube comments could help you develop new content: YouTube users aren't shy about expressing their opinions. Pay attentions to what they're saying about your content, and how can develop new content that they want to see.

## How to Comment on a YouTube Video

Moderating comments that appear on your video is important (and we'll get to the details of that in a minute) but as a brand, you'll want to pipe up with your own commentary, too.

Each comment you leave is another reference and exposure to your brand (and a chance to make a great impression on the YouTube algorithm). Start a conversation (on your own video or in another user's comment section) or chime in with your brand two cents elsewhere.

**To make a comment:**

Step1 Below the video itself, find the comment section.

![find the comment section youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/find-the-comment-section-youtube.jpg)

Step2 Type your message in the add a comment field. (if you're writing on your phone you can tap the comment section to expand it.

Step3 Click comment to post.

A successful YouTube comment from a brand should offer some value, and go beyond trying to make a sale.

Try sharing an interesting observation, cracking a joke, revealing helpful information or showing compassion or care for a fan. And if you can't turn on the charm, a humble thumbs up or heart can still go a long way to show that you're listening.

**How to view and edit comment on YouTube**

To manage your comments on YouTube using a PC, the operating system does not matter. Since you make changes via any browser, the process is the same, whether you use Windows, macOS, Linux, or any other OS.

**Follow theses steps to amend comments on YouTube:**

## Highlighted Comments and Replies on YouTube

Among the comments you see on a video, you might notice some that YouTube has labeled “Highlighted Comment.” that label is specific to you, and only appears in your comments list. YouTube that you have a particular interest in a section of comments.

For example, you might click on a notification, and YouTube takes you to a particular video. Then, when somebody else views and leaves a comment on that video, YouTube will often add the “Highlighted Comment” label on the comment to make it easy for you to spot it when you next go back to that video.

Each time YouTube adds the “highlighted comment” or “highlighted reply” tags to a video, they create a unique URL. The version of the comment that you see uses this newly generated URL. Therefore, the only way to make these labels disappear (apart from reading the new comments) is to remove the addition to the URL.

## Why Deleting YouTube Comments?

If you consume a lot of YouTube content, you've likely posted hundreds or even thousands of comments on various channels. You might want to:

Delete comments that think are no longer relevant in light of recent developments.

Delete comments that you deem offensive, rude, or disrespectful toward other users.

Edit typos on comments that you posted.

Edit a comment to include new, more relevant information.

Retrieve a comment so that you can share it with others outside of YouTube.

Comments history also contains the link to the video where you've left the comment along with the date and time when the comment was made. Clicking on this link will open the video page with your comment highlighted at the top of the comment section.
