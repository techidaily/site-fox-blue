Firstly, you should focus on creating a proper design or video that you want to share on your social accounts. In case you have already such a thing on your device or in the Canva library, you should open it in the editor’s interface. After that, you should work on adding audio files.

**Step 2: Upload Audio**

Secondly, you should proceed with a small procedure of uploading audio files to the Canva. Canva allows uploading any kind of file from external sources or devices. It can be useful in adding desired audio and sound effects to the video. For such a thing, you can see the UPLOAD tab in the menu. You should visit the tab and click the UPLOAD MEDIA button.

**Step 3: Pick Audio File**

When you click the button, it will lead to a device folder interface. By using this interface, you should locate the folder where your desired audio file and available and select it for uploading or adding in the Canva.

**Step 4: Find Out Audio**

![Find audio file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/canva-video-3.png)

After uploading the file, you can easily use it for creating desired design or video. Here, you should visit the AUDIO tab from the side panel. In case you cannot see such an option, you will definitely get the MORE button, so, proceed by clicking it. After exploring more, you can easily see that particular button.

**Step 5:Add Audio To Design**

In the audio tab, you can see the recently uploaded final. You should proceed by choosing this particular file. It will help you make lots of things easier and better.

It is the complete procedure that you can follow to add an audio file to the Canva. You can also find several audio files inside the Canva that can feature your design or video as well. But, it depends on your requirements and creative ideas and how you want to proceed.

## Part 2 Crop Music You Added On Canva

When it comes to video or audio editing, the biggest thing is trimming. Trimming helps to reduce the content length or time duration by which you can share the video with appropriate time limits. With the following procedure, you can easily edit the audio file.

## Part 3 Edit Your Music On Canva

**Step 1: Open My Media**

In the navigation system or side panel, you can find out MY MEDIA section. It will help you get access to the available media files that are linked to your Canva account.

**Step 2: Gray Pencil**

Now, you should proceed by choosing the GRAY PENCIL ICON. You can find out this icon with the video. Generally, it is considered as an edit symbol that will allow you to access the complete edit panel without any problem.

**Step 3: Launch Editor And Edit**

You should click the edit icon and launch the respective interface. In case you want to trim the audio, you can use left and right brackets and drag them to the positions. The left bracket will help you decide the starting point and the right one help you pick the ending point. By using both, you can pick a section that you want to add to the video.

If you like to chop the audio, you should choose the section by using the scissors icon. The selected audio section will be removed and the remaining can be added to the video. As for the editor features, you can also apply fades to the audio. It will help you to mix different audios or create some low moments in the video.

**Step 4: Preview**

After making all these edits on video and audio, you should merge both files. Before proceeding to the final step, it will be good if you consider a preview. Preview will help you understand the video is created perfectly or not. In case there’s any kind of issue with the video, you will get it during preview and fix it immediately.

**Step 5: Save & Download**

In case you are satisfied with the preview results, you should click the SAVE or SAVE A COPY button. You can also download the file to get it on your device and share it on other platforms.

It is the complete procedure that will help you to edit an audio file on Canva with ease.
