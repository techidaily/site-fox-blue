## Part 1: 7 Types of Shots in film You Should Know

### 1\. Establishing Shot

As the name hints itself, this type of camera shot basically establishes the scene the audience sees as the [first shot of your movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishing%5Fshot).

In other words, the establishing shot provides the viewers a maximum of the city or the whole building scene in one frame.

This doesn’t help your audience guess what location is the scene is being shot but they can estimate the time when the scene is taking place.

With this type of [shot in the film](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you are typically showing and not telling the audience through narrative and it is completely enough to let the audience know the concept.

### 2\. Extreme Long Shot

This type of camera shot is taken from a long distance. This brings the audience an idea where the character belongs to regarding the time and the place.

You will also allow the audience to know the emotional relationship to the environment where there is no need to show the character.

### 3\. Long Shot

Long shot or often known as the wide shot uses characters in the shot. Each character is shown head to toe in relation to the surroundings, location or each other.

Also, the chief character or say the protagonist should have a major presence in the frame.

Moreover, while using this type of camera shot, you must take care that it should be dominated by the scenery.

### 4\. Full Shot

Here, the location can be ignored from keeping in the focus.

The main focus should be on the character in such type of shot in the film. Also, the shot should highlight the action or the movement of the character from head to toe and not his/her [emotional condition](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/07/21/743408637/how-microexpressions-can-make-moods-contagious).

For instance, the audience must get the idea whether your character is confident, weird or sophisticated with just his/her appearance, outfit and the action.

### 5\. Medium Shot

Medium shot basically stands between the full and the close-up shot.

Putting differently, this type of camera shot shows an amalgamation of the body actions and the facial expressions.

The purpose of this shot is to keep the character looking natural.
