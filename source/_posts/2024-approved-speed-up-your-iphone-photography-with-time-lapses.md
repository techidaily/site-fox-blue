In time-lapse video, a large number of images are taken over a period of time then put together to create footage that seems to be sped up. Time-lapse videos are ideal for quickly showing how things develop over a period and are often created when buildings are being constructed, projects are being worked or to show how a scene changes over the course of a day. There are many different apps that you can download to your iPhone to obtain exceptional time-lapse video footage, with effects including Loop, Bounce and Long Exposure.

## Part1: How to record time-lapse video

If you wish to record time-lapse video on your iPhone, you will need the most recent version of iOS. For best results and a higher-resolution, use a modern iPhone as these can even offer 4K video at a maximum of 30 frames-per-second. Here are the steps you need to take to get started.

* Open the iPhone Camera app, swiping right or down to get to the Time-Lapse section.
* Tap the Record button to begin recording your video
* Tap again to stop and save the video.
* To find your video, head to the Photos app’s Recently Added, Camera Roll or Video sections.

## Part2: What you need to know before you begin

**Shorter time -** It’s usually best to shoot for a long period of time to get the best results. The footage you obtain will be much shorter than the length of time you are shooting for, which means you will need to remain patient to get the best results. You can usually get around 40 seconds of time-lapse footage from a 10-minute session, which means you would need to shoot for around an hour to make a four-minute clip. The reason for this is that the footage is played at a specific number of frames per second, which is substantially more frames than the app you will be using can capture. The number of frames taken per second will depend not only on the app you are using but the settings you choose too.

**Be stable -** Your iPhone also needs to remain as stable as possible so you can prevent camera from motioning and jittering and avoid compromising the quality of the results. If you are able to use a tripod or stand rather than holding your device in your hand, this will be very helpful. Don’t forget to lock the focus, exposure or both before you start recording. You also need to ensure that your iPhone has enough storage space to capture and hold your video. Time-lapse videos can be data-heavy due to the way the feature uses a large buffer and video cache. This is especially important if you are shooting in hi-resolution.
