TextDelay is a native plugin, meaning that you will find it already installed on After Effects. As the name suggests, you can use TextDelay to delay any other text transformations that you may add to the text and it allows you to delay these transformations by word, line, or even character.

## Cartoon Moblur

Link: <https://www.toolfarm.com/buy/plugin%5Feverything%5Fcartoon%5Fmoblur>

This is the most ideal plugin to choose when you want to add motion trail to the graphics in your video, but you want them to appear very cartoony. If you have used the motion blur effect in After Effects, Cartoon Moblur will behave in a similar function, but it is more suited to 2D, flat or minimal graphics. Some of the factors that you can customize include the length of the blur (shutter angle), color, and opacity.

## Conclusion

On its own After Effects comes with so many post-production effects and features to make your project appear professional and well made. But if you would like to have a unique video production that stands head and shoulders above all others, plugins are a great way to do that. The good news is that After Effects allows for the use of plugins developed by third-party developers and some of the them like the text plugins, we have listed above can be very useful to a videoâ€™s production.
