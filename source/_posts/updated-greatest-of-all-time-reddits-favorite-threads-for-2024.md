(r/wallstreetbets)

![times square billboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/times-square-billboard.png)

Its purpose is quite ironic. The point was to make this image of Chancellor Palpatine from Star Wars the first result on Google whenever someone searched for "The Senate."

Sadly, the attempt failed but still received a lot of attention.

### 2\. $GME GO BRRR (r/wallstreetbets)

This post currently has 469k votes with a stunning 99% Upvote rate. It’s now the most upvoted Reddit post in this list.
