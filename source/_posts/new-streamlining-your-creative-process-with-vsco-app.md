White balancing is another technique through which you can enhance the colors present in your picture. VSCO Photo Editor has this advanced function through which you can increase the temperature of the image by highlighting the colors, or you can add a tint to make the colors softer.

### 7\. Control the Saturation

Saturation in photography means controlling the sharpness and intensity of the colors. If you have captured a faded color photo, you increase its intensity by enhancing its saturation. As a result, the human eye will automatically give attention to the color details in your picture.

### 8\. Adjust the Intensity of Filters

Filters are the best thing present in every photo editor. However, VSCO edits are different than any ordinary photo editor as it gives the option to control the intensity of your picture in each filter. Thus, you can add layers of filters to your image and adjust their intensity according to your will.
