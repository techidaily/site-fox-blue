[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step1 First, download Filmora’s latest version from the official website. Download the app from the [**Play Store**](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) or [**App Store**](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) if you are a mobile user.

Launch the software and click the **“Screen Recorder”** option on the main software or app interface. A pop-up will open up, showing a red round button.

Next, head to YouTube and search for two Game of Thrones Keen songs one by one for recording. Finally, click the red button to start recording and **“F9”** to stop. The recorded songs will show in the Filmora Project folder.

Step2 Drag the recorded songs from the folder to the **“Timeline Panel.”** Now, right-click the video files and select **“Detach Audio”** to extract Game of Thrones audio from videos.

![detach audio filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/detach-audio-filmora.PNG)

Step3 In this step, right-click a particular file whose silent parts you want to delete and select “Silence Detection.” Now, a window will open up showing three parameters; **“Threshold,” “Minimum Silence,” and “Buffer,”** which you can adjust manually by moving the slider.

Furthermore, you can click **“Start”** to roll automatic silence detection, eliminating all the silent parts.

![silence detection parameters filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/silence-detection-parameters-filmora.PNG)

Step4 Now, emphasize one Game of Thrones Keen audio over the other. For this, right-click a specific file and select **“Adjust Audio.”** Then, check the **“Audio Ducking”** feature and click **“OK”** to make changes to the file.
