## Spotlight on Snapchat: A User's Handbook for Highlights

Snapchat is one of the most popular instant messaging apps. The key feature that makes it different from other messaging apps is that users can send text messages, pictures, and short videos that disappear after they are viewed.

Over the years, Snapchat has introduced various features that elevated its status from being an instant messaging app to a social media platform. In November 2020, Snapchat rolled out a new feature called Spotlight that has become a massive hit among users.

The Spotlight feature aims to make Snapchat compete with TikTok and Instagram Reels. As you may have guessed now, Spotlight is a collection of the most entertaining videos posted by app users.

Whether you want to post your videos on Snapchat Spotlight or want to know more about them, you just need to go through this article.

## What Exactly is Snapchat Spotlight?

Snapchat introduced Spotlight as a whole new section in its app that features several engaging short videos, also known as Snaps. The maximum duration of a video can be up to 1 minute or 60 seconds. Content creators must submit their videos to Spotlight so that moderators can review them and decide if they are worthy of featuring in the Spotlight section.

As mentioned earlier, the intention of adding the Spotlight feature in Snapchat is to engage users through short-form user videos, just like TikTok. After the massive popularity gained by TikTok in 2020, many platforms tried following the same path to glory, including Snapchat and Instagram.

### Snapchat Spotlight vs TikTok: Main Differences

When comparing Snapchat and TikTok, there are specific differences that you can quickly notice. Let's discuss those differences below:

**● Comments Sections**

While watching short-form videos on TikTok, you can leave your thoughts in the comments. However, you get no such comments section in the Snapchat Spotlight.

**● Privacy Protection**

If we talk about TikTok, you can view the display name of the content creator for each video. On the other hand, Snapchat enforces a strict privacy protection mechanism that hides the display name of creators if they are under 18\. However, there's an option to use a public profile if users below 18 wish to make their display name available to viewers.

### Guidelines for Submitting Snapchat Spotlight

It's easy to submit snaps (short-form videos) on Snapchat Spotlight. However, it is essential to ensure that your videos adhere to specific guidelines set by Snapchat. This section aims to make you familiar with them.

**Video Requirements**

The snaps that you want to submit to Spotlight should meet the following technical requirements:

* The minimum duration of a snap is 5 seconds, while the maximum is 60 seconds.
* The video should be in portrait orientation.
* The minimum aspect ratio of a snap is 3:4.
* The horizontal resolution of a snap must be at least 640 px.
* There shouldn't be any logo in the snap.
* The content of the snap should cover the complete frame.

If your snap doesn't meet the above-mentioned requirements, it will become ineligible for getting featured on Spotlight.

**Submission Terms**

There are certain community guidelines that apply to all Spotlight snaps. These guidelines ensure that the snaps within Spotlight entertain people without hurting their sentiments in any way.

While posting a snap on Spotlight, you need to avoid content that contains the following:

* Sexual acts
* Harassment and bullying
* Threats, violence, or harm
* Illegal activities
* Terrorism and hate speech

You can go through the official [Snapchat community guidelines](https://snap.com/en-US/community-guidelines) to learn more.

## How to Use Snapchat Spotlight?

Snapchat Spotlight is relatively easy to use, especially if you are familiar with YouTube Shorts and TikTok. If you want to submit snaps to Spotlight, you will be happy to know that the whole process is quick and straightforward. The only thing that will consume a significant time is the snap creation itself.

If you already have a video or a snap idea that can make it to Spotlight, you need to know the steps for submitting a snap to Spotlight. We will discuss them in the next section.

### How to Post on Spotlight?

## How to Become a Successful Snapchat Spotlight Creator?

From what has been mentioned above, you will master how to use Snapchat Spotlight. Then, here comes another important question: How to become a successful Snapchat creator?

Similar to TikTok and YouTube Shorts, there's massive competition among creators on Snapchat. Both existing and new creators submit numerous snaps daily to get featured on Spotlight. So, how come you improve your chances of making it to Spotlight?

Well, the first thing you need to know is the algorithm that Snapchat Spotlight utilizes to show snaps to users. Secondly, there are some tips to help you build your Snapchat community. We'll discuss both of them in the following sections.

### Snapchat Spotlight Algorithm: A Brief Overview

Snapchat makes use of a specialized algorithm for Spotlight. The algorithm decides what snaps to show to a particular user based on their interests and other factors.

The following are the key factors that the Spotlight algorithm considers for showing users the most relevant and exciting snaps.

**Unique Views**

A unique view means a user viewed a snap at least once in a single session. If a user views a snap multiple times in a single session, it will still be considered a unique view.

**Total View Time**

It represents the total time that users have spent watching a snap. If a user watches a single snap multiple times, the duration of each individual view will be added to the total view time.

**Number of Times the Video was Shared**

It represents the total number of times Snapchat users shared a particular snap with others.

**Number of Screenshots**

This factor considers the total number of times a screenshot was taken of a snap by a user.

### Quick Tips to Build Your Snapchat Community

Your Snapchat community is your audience who loves to watch and interact with your snaps. Building a Snapchat community means growing your audience by delivering genuine, entertaining, and engaging content.

Here are some tips that can help you build a Snapchat community.

**Choose a Niche**

Uploading random snaps will not earn you a loyal audience on Spotlight. So, you need to pick a specific niche, such as gaming, pranks, and comedy, to target a particular audience with your snaps.

**Use Snapchat’s Built-in Creative Tools**

Snapchat provides several tools to help you become more creative with your snaps. Using those creative tools is good as the Spotlight algorithm pretends to prioritize videos edited with Snapchat's native tools.

**Stay Consistent**

It is challenging to post snaps consistently, especially if you are just starting. However, maintaining consistency with your Snaps will help you earn more audience.

## A Bonus Tip: A Great Video Editor Facilitates Your Snapchat Creating Journey
