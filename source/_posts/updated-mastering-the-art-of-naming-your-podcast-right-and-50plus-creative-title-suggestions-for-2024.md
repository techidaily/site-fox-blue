Research shows that 75% of podcast names online are 29 characters or less. So, avoid lengthy words.

For example, if your podcast is about football, you can use Football Weekly Roundup, EPL Digest, etc. Using short names will make it easy for first-timers to remember your podcast name the next time they intend to search it online.
