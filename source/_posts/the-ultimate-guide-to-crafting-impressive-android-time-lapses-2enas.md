## Part4: Differences between Hyper Lapse and Time Lapse

You have learnt almost everything about time-lapse videography. We also think you should know how hyper-lapse and time-lapse distinguishes from each other. These two techniques are not same. The technique of hyper-lapse video includes a moving camera in contrast with the time-lapse videos. It is part of time-lapse videography where the camera is moving at different angles and exposures. Keeping it simpler, a time-lapse video is made with keeping camera undisturbed whereas hyper-lapse videos involverecording the video while moving the camera.

## Final Verdict

Now you have mastered everything about time-lapse videos and time lapse apps on Android. We are positive that you got useful information from this post. Nevertheless, we would like to advise you to go for the converting process on desktop. This will help in giving better and quality results because using a phone for the process can be complicated and become uneasy to operate. If you make up your mind on using desktop, Filmora is the most recommended product to use which will help in creating remarkable time-lapse videos.
