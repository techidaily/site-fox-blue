The biography has a normal word count, but the words lift a feeling of trust-worthy and a person who knows a way to live and enjoy his life.

## Part 3\. Make Him or Her Swipe Right: Create Attractive Profiles

Tinder bio is a small blank space that takes a minute to fill but content matters. While guys most probably swipe over the top to bottom without noting down the Tinder profile description, girls are selective in choosing the perfect match before swipe right.

### 4\. Synchronize with other social media network

If the 500-word limit in **Tinder profile** isn’t enough to express, sync it to other social media platforms, like Instagram. It will lead to popularity among others, and instant uploading in Tinder will reflect on Instagram.

### 5\. Be real and honest

Even though tinder is just an online dating app, it doesn’t mean that you should be unreal or dishonest. You can be casual as it is getting around with new people, and hence you need to be clear in whom you are, what you like, and what you need.
